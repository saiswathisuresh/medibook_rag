NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion BONE-A PRINCIPLES OF BONE CANCER MANAGEMENT Biopsy • Prior to biopsy, consultation should be obtained with an orthopedic oncologist regarding appropriate prebiopsy imaging. • Preoperative biopsy consultation with a pediatric oncologist as appropriate is recommended for children. • Biopsy diagnosis is necessary prior to any surgical procedure or fixation of primary site. • Biopsy is optimally performed at a center that will do definitive management. • Placement of biopsy is critical. • Biopsy should be core needle or surgical biopsy. • Technique: Apply same principles for core needle or open biopsy. Needle biopsy is not recommended for skull base tumors. • Appropriate communication between the surgeon, musculoskeletal or interventional radiologist, and bone pathologist is critical. • Fresh tissue may be needed for molecular studies and tissue banking. • In general, not following appropriate biopsy procedures may lead to adverse patient outcomes. Surgery • Wide excision should achieve histologically negative surgical margins. • Negative surgical margins optimize local tumor control. • Local tumor control may be achieved by either limb-sparing excision or limb amputation (individualized for a given patient). • Limb-sparing excision is preferred to optimize function if reasonable functional expectations can be achieved. • Final pathologic evaluation should include assessment of surgical margins, size/dimensions of tumor, and response to preoperative therapy. • Fresh tissue may be needed for molecular studies and tissue banking. Laboratory Studies • Laboratory studies such as CBC, LDH, and ALP may have relevance in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients with bone sarcoma and should be done prior to definitive treatment and periodically during treatment and surveillance. • Consider molecular studies to delineate potential therapeutic options. Treatment • Fertility issues should be addressed with patients prior to commencing chemotherapy. • See NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology. • Select patients with osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma may benefit from a referral for genetic consultation and testing based on family history with a genetic predisposition for bone sarcomas. • Care for patients with bone cancer should be delivered directly by physicians on the multidisciplinary team (category 1). See TEAM-1. Long-Term Follow-up and Surveillance/Survivorship • Patients should have a survivorship prescription to schedule follow-up with a multidisciplinary team. • Life-long follow-up is recommended for surveillance and treatment of late effects of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy in long-term survivors. • See NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship.

Alternative total dose and fractionation schemes are necessary for specialized techniques such as SRS and stereotactic body RT (SBRT). General Treatment and Dosing Information - Chondrosarcoma Dosing Prescription Regimen • Low-grade extracompartmental appendicular or grade I axial tumors \u0017Unresectable: ◊Consider RT (70 Gy) with specialized techniques. • High-grade, clear cell, or extracompartmental \u0017Resectable:1 ◊Preoperative RT: Consider if positive margins are likely (19.8–50.4 Gy) followed by individualized postoperative RT with final target dose of 70 Gy for R1 resection and 72–78 Gy for R2 resection. ◊Postoperative RT: Consider, especially for high-grade/dedifferentiated subtype, 70 Gy for R1 and >70 Gy for R2 resection using specialized techniques. ◊Radiation is not needed for R0 resection; there should be no pre- or postoperative considerations. \u0017Unresectable: ◊Consider RT (>70 Gy) with specialized techniques.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-2 Overview Primary bone cancers are extremely rare neoplasms accounting for ~0.2% of all cancers, although the true incidence is difficult to determine secondary to the rarity of these tumors.1 In 2023 an estimated 3,970 people will be diagnosed in the United States and 2,140 people will die from the disease.2 Primary bone cancers demonstrate wide clinical heterogeneity and may be curable with proper treatment. In adults, chondrosarcoma is the most common primary bone cancer, accounting for 40%, followed by osteosarcoma (28%), chordoma (10%), Ewing sarcoma (8%), and lastly undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)/fibrosarcoma (4%). In children and adolescents, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are far more common than chondrosarcoma and chordoma.3 High-grade UPS of bone, fibrosarcoma, and giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) are relatively rare tumors, with each constituting less than 5% of primary bone tumors.4 GCTB has both benign and malignant forms, with the benign form being the most common subtype. Various types of bone cancers are named based on their histologic origin: chondrosarcomas arise from cartilage, osteosarcomas arise from bone, and fibrogenic tissue is the origin of fibrosarcoma of bone, whereas vascular tissue gives rise to hemangioendothelioma and hemangiopericytoma. Notochordal tissue gives rise to chordoma. Several primary bone cancers, including Ewing sarcoma, are of unknown histologic origin. Chondrosarcoma usually arises in middle-aged and older adults. Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma develop mainly in children and young adults. Chordoma is more common in males, with the peak incidence in the fifth to sixth decade of life.5,6 The pathogenesis and etiology of most bone cancers remain unclear. Gene rearrangements between the EWS and ETS family of genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma.7-10 Specific germline mutations have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.11,12 Li-Fraumeni syndrome characterized by a germline mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with a high risk of developing osteosarcoma.13-15 Osteosarcoma is the most common second primary malignancy in patients with a history of retinoblastoma, characterized by a mutation in the retinoblastoma gene RB1.11,16,17 Increased incidences of osteosarcoma have also been associated with other genetic mutations and inherited genetic predisposition syndromes.11 Osteosarcoma is also the most common radiation-induced bone sarcoma.18,19 The development of multiagent chemotherapy regimens for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment has considerably improved the prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.20,21 With current multimodality treatment, approximately three quarters of all patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma are cured and 90% to 95% of patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma can be successfully treated with limb-sparing approaches rather than amputation.22 Survival rates have improved to almost 70% in patients with localized Ewing sarcoma.21 In patients with Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma, a cure is still achievable in selected patients diagnosed with metastatic disease at presentation.23,24 The 5-year survival across all types of primary bone cancers is 66.8%.1 The NCCN Guidelines for Bone Cancer focus on chordoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. The guidelines also provide recommendations for treating GCTB. Although typically benign, GCTB is locally aggressive and can lead to significant bone destruction. Guidelines Update Methodology The complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at www.NCCN.org.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-3 Guidelines update, using the following search terms: chondrosarcoma OR chordoma OR Ewing sarcoma OR giant cell tumor of the bone OR osteosarcoma OR bone sarcoma OR primary bone cancer OR primary bone neoplasm OR primary bone tumor. The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial; Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines and discussed by the panel have been included in this version of the Discussion section (eg, e-publications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). Recommendations for which high-level evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of lower-level evidence and expert opinion. Sensitive/Inclusive Language Usage NCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use language that is person-first; not stigmatizing; anti-racist, anti-classist, anti- misogynist, anti-ageist, anti-ableist, and anti-fat-biased; and inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non-gendered language, instead focusing on organ-specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their future analyses. Staging The eighth edition of the AJCC staging classification (2018) is based on the assessment of histologic grade (G), tumor size (T), and presence of regional (N) and/or distant metastases (M).25 The NCCN Panel would like to clarify that although some studies interpret imaging before chemotherapy treatment based on the extent of tumor invasion relative to the periosteum (eg, extraperiosteal, intraperiosteal) for prognostic purposes, these terms do not specifically occur in any validated staging systems and the significance is unknown. Principles of Bone Cancer Management Multidisciplinary Team Involvement Primary bone tumors and selected metastatic tumors should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team of physicians with demonstrated expertise in the management of these tumors. Long-term surveillance and follow-up are necessary when considering the risk of recurrence and comorbidities associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT). Life-long follow-up is recommended for surveillance and treatment of late effects of surgery, RT, and chemotherapy in long-term survivors. Patients should be given a survivorship prescription to schedule follow-up with a multidisciplinary team. Fertility issues should be discussed with appropriate patients.26 For information on disease- and survivorship-related issues for adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients, please refer to the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology as clinically appropriate.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-4 family history of genetic predisposition to bone sarcomas may benefit from genetic consultation and testing. Diagnostic Workup Suspicion of a malignant bone tumor in a patient with a symptomatic lesion often begins when a poorly marginated lesion is seen on a plain radiograph. In patients <40 years, an aggressive, symptomatic bone lesion has a significant risk of being a malignant primary bone tumor, and referral to an orthopedic oncologist should be considered prior to further workup. In patients ≥40 years of age, CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast; bone scan; mammogram; and other imaging studies as clinically indicated should be performed if plain radiographs do not suggest a specific diagnosis.27 All patients with suspected bone sarcoma should undergo complete staging prior to biopsy. Prior to biopsy, consultation should be obtained with an orthopedic oncologist regarding appropriate pre-biopsy imaging. The standard staging workup for a suspected primary bone cancer should include chest imaging (chest radiograph or chest CT to detect pulmonary metastases), appropriate imaging of the primary site (plain radiographs, MRI for local staging, and/or CT scan), and bone scan or PET/CT.28 Whole-body MRI is a sensitive imaging technique for the detection of skeletal metastases in patients with small cell neoplasms, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma.29,30 Imaging of painless bone lesions should be evaluated by a musculoskeletal radiologist followed by appropriate referral to a multidisciplinary treatment team if necessary. Laboratory studies, such as complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) with calcium to assess for hypercalcemia, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) should be done prior to initiation of treatment. PET/CT is an alternative imaging technique that has been utilized in the pretreatment staging of soft tissue and bone sarcomas.31,32 Published reports have demonstrated the utility of PET scans in the evaluation of response to chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and advanced chordoma.33-36 PET/CT with the investigational radioactive substance 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) has been shown to identify the hypoxic component in residual chordomas prior to RT.37 This approach is being evaluated and would be helpful in identifying tumors with low oxygen levels that are more resistant to RT. Biopsy Percutaneous biopsy (core needle or fine-needle aspiration [FNA]) and incisional (open) biopsy are the two techniques historically used in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal lesions.38,39 Open biopsy is the most accurate method because of larger sample size, which is useful for performing additional studies such as immunohistochemistry or cytogenetics.40 However, open biopsy requires general or regional anesthesia and operating room facilities, whereas core biopsy can be performed under local anesthesia, with or without sedation. Core needle biopsy has also been used as an alternative to open biopsy for the diagnosis of musculoskeletal lesions with accuracy rates ranging from 88% to 96% when adequate samples are obtained.41-44 Core biopsy is associated with a low complication rate and cost savings may be realized when needle biopsy is employed in selected patients.41,44,45 Advances in imaging techniques have contributed to the increasing use of image-guided percutaneous biopsy for the diagnosis of primary and secondary bone tumors.46 Furthermore, rates of complications, particularly altered treatment and outcomes, are considerably higher with open biopsy.47 Although no randomized controlled trials have compared core needle biopsy with open biopsy, the higher complication rate and cost of open biopsy have resulted in a shift to the use of primarily core biopsy for diagnosis.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-5 The guidelines recommend core needle or open biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of primary bone tumor prior to any surgical procedure or fixation of primary site. Biopsy should be performed at the center that will provide definitive treatment for patients with a suspected primary malignant bone tumor. At the time of biopsy, careful consideration should be given to appropriate stabilization of the bone and/or measures to protect against impending pathologic fracture. The placement of biopsy is critical to the planning of limb-sparing surgery, and failure to follow appropriate biopsy procedures may lead to adverse patient outcomes.38,39 In a multicenter review of 597 patients with musculoskeletal tumors, alteration of the treatment plan (complex resection or the use of adjunctive treatment) was encountered in 19% of patients and unnecessary amputation was performed in 18 patients.47 Both core needle and open biopsy techniques are associated with risk of local tumor recurrence either by tumor spillage or tumor seeding along the biopsy tract, if the scar is not removed en bloc during the tumor resection. The risk of tumor seeding is less with core needle biopsy.48-50 Nevertheless, the same principles should be applied for core needle and open biopsy. Appropriate communication between the surgeon, musculoskeletal or interventional radiologist, and bone pathologist is critical in planning the biopsy route. In the case of children, consultation with a pediatric oncologist is recommended. It is essential to select the biopsy route in collaboration with the surgeon to ensure that the biopsy tract lies within the planned resection bed so that it can be resected with the same wide margins as the primary tumor during surgery. Although the risk of tumor seeding is not significant with FNA biopsy, it is not suitable for the diagnosis of primary lesions since the diagnostic accuracy of FNA is less than that of core needle biopsy.51 Surgery Surgical margins should be negative for most sarcomas, wide enough to minimize potential local recurrence, and narrow enough to maximize function. Wide excision implies histologically negative surgical margins and it is necessary to optimize local control. Local control may be achieved either by limb-sparing surgery or amputation. In selected cases, amputation may be the most appropriate option to achieve this goal. However, limb-sparing surgery is preferred if reasonable functional outcomes can be achieved. Final pathologic evaluation should include assessment of surgical margins and size/dimensions of tumor. The response to the preoperative therapy should be evaluated utilizing pathologic mapping. Consultation with a physiatrist is recommended to evaluate for mobility training and to prescribe an appropriate rehabilitation program. Radiation Therapy RT is used either as an adjuvant to surgery for patients with resectable tumors or as definitive therapy in patients with tumors not amenable to surgery. Specialized techniques such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT); particle beam RT with protons, carbon ions, or other heavy ions; or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)/stereotactic RT (SRT) should be considered as clinically indicated in order to deliver high radiation doses while maximizing normal tissue sparing.52,53 RT should be administered at the same specialized center that is providing surgical and systemic interventions. See Principles of Radiation Therapy in the algorithm for treatment volumes and radiation doses specific to each subtype. Chondrosarcoma Chondrosarcomas characteristically produce cartilage matrices from neoplastic tissue devoid of osteoid and may occur at any age, but they are more common in older adults.54,55 They may be classified according to the location from which they arise, with the pelvis and the proximal femur Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-6 being the most common primary sites of origin. They may also be distinguished by their location along the bone as follows: 1) primary or central lesions (arising normally from the medullary cavity) originating from previously normal-appearing bone preformed from cartilage; or 2) secondary or peripheral tumors (arising from the periosteum) that develop from preexisting benign cartilage lesions, such as enchondromas, or from the cartilaginous portion of an osteochondroma.54,56,57 Conventional chondrosarcoma of the bone constitutes approximately nearly 90% of all chondrosarcomas and of these 90% are low to intermediate grade.58 Malignant transformation has been reported in patients with Ollier disease (enchondromatosis) and Maffucci syndrome (enchondromatosis associated with soft tissue hemangioma).59 The peripheral or secondary tumors are usually low grade with infrequent metastasis.60 Nearly 65% of chondrosarcoma cases and nearly all cases of Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are related to isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 or IDH2) mutations.58,61-63 Other implicated genetic aberrations include inactivating mutations of CDKN2A and COL2A1.57 In addition to conventional chondrosarcoma, there are several non-conventional subtypes constituting about 10% to 15% of all chondrosarcomas.54 These include clear cell, juxtacortical, dedifferentiated, myxoid, and mesenchymal forms of chondrosarcoma.54,64,65 Primary skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (myxoid chondrosarcoma of bone) is an extremely rare neoplasm that has not been fully characterized as a distinct clinicopathologic entity.66,67 It is considered to be a myxoid variant of intermediate- or high-grade chondrosarcoma and is commonly located in the bones around the hip joint.54,67 An epidemiologic study of mesenchymal chondrosarcomas using the SEER database found that 40% of these were skeletal and 60% were extraskeletal.68 Research suggests that alterations in the retinoblastoma pathway are present in a significant majority of clear cell, dedifferentiated, and mesenchymal chondrosarcomas.64 Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, on the other hand, is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that is characterized by chromosomal translocations t(9;22)(q22;q11-12) or t(9;17)(q22;q11), generating the fusion genes EWS::CHN (EWSR1::NR4A3) or RBP56::CHN (TAF2N::NR4A3), respectively.69,70 In addition, two other variant chromosomal translocations, t(9;15)(q22;q21) and t(3;9)(q12;q22), resulting in fusion genes TCF12::NR4A3 and TFG::NR4A3, respectively, have also been identified in case reports.71 A retrospective study demonstrated prolonged overall survival (OS) in patients with extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma despite high rates of local and distant recurrence.72 The data also revealed a significant pattern of decreased event-free survival (EFS) with increasing tumor size. Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma is not included in the NCCN Guidelines for Bone Cancer. Symptoms of chondrosarcoma are usually mild and depend on tumor size and location. Patients with pelvic or axial lesions typically present later in the disease course, as the associated pain has a more insidious onset and often occurs when the tumor has reached a significant size.73-75 Central chondrosarcomas demonstrate cortical destruction and loss of medullary bone trabeculations on radiographs, as well as calcification and destruction.74 MRI will show the intramedullary involvement as well as extraosseous extension of the tumor. Secondary lesions arise from preexisting lesions. Serial radiographs will demonstrate a slow increase in size of the osteochondroma or enchondroma. A cartilage “cap” measuring greater than 2 cm on a pre-existing lesion or documented growth after skeletal maturity should raise the suspicion of sarcomatous transformation.76 Prognostic Factors Whether the lesion is primary or secondary, central or peripheral, the anatomic location, histologic grade, and size of the lesion are essential prognostic features.68,73,77-81 In an analysis of 2890 patients with Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-7 chondrosarcoma from the SEER database, female sex, a low histologic grade, and local surgical stage were associated with a significant disease-specific survival benefit in the univariate analysis, whereas only grade and stage had significant association with disease-specific survival on multivariate analysis.82 An epidemiologic study examined the impact of demographic and tumor characteristics on OS.68 No differences in OS were observed between skeletal and extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, with a 5- and 10-year OS of 51% and 43%, respectively. Anatomic tumor location was a significant prognostic factor, with poorer OS observed among patients with axial versus cranial or appendicular tumor locations. Cranial tumors had different clinical behavior compared with axial and appendicular locations with data suggesting better OS for younger patients. Prognostic factors were also examined in a retrospective, multi-institutional analysis of 225 patients with low-grade chondrosarcoma.83 Metastasis-free survival (MFS) probability was 95% at 5 years and 92% at 10 years. A low histologic grade and no recurrence had a significant MFS benefit, but tumor size at diagnosis and surgical margin width had no effect on MFS. In a SEER database analysis, differences in the presence of metastasis were noted among the various chondrosarcoma subtypes.65 Dedifferentiated (19.8%) followed by mesenchymal (10.6%) chondrosarcoma were most associated with the presence of metastasis on presentation, whereas juxtacortical chondrosarcoma was least associated (2.1%) with the presence of metastasis on presentation.65 Similarly, median survival was found to be lowest with the dedifferentiated subtype (11 months) and highest with the juxtacortical subtype (97 months).65 Treatment Surgery Wide excision with negative margins is the preferred primary treatment for patients with large tumors and pelvic localization, irrespective of the grade.79,84-86 Wide resection with adequate surgical margins is associated with higher EFS and OS rates in patients with chondrosarcoma of axial skeleton and pelvic girdle. The 10-year OS and EFS rates were 61% and 44%, respectively, for patients who underwent resection with adequate surgical margins compared to the corresponding survival rates of 17% and 0% for those who underwent resection with inadequate surgical margins.87 Intralesional curettage with adjuvant cryosurgery has been shown to be associated with low rates of recurrence in patients with grade I intracompartmental chondrosarcomas.88-90 In selected patients with low-grade and less radiographically aggressive, non-pelvic chondrosarcomas, intralesional excision can be used as an alternative to wide excision without compromising outcomes.91-94 This approach should be restricted to extremity tumors.95 Intralesional excision is considered the standard treatment for extremity chondrosarcoma tumors. In a meta-analysis comparing outcome in patients with central, low-grade (grade I) chondrosarcoma of the long bones following either intralesional excision or wide resection, there was little difference in the recurrence-free survival between both groups after 24 months. The rate of major complications was found to be higher following wide resection of the lesion (230 per 1000 vs. 40 per 1000 for intralesional curettage).96 Radiation Therapy Primary RT can be considered for borderline resectable and unresectable disease (category 2B). RT is also recommended after incomplete resection or for palliation of symptoms in patients with recurrent tumors.54,55 In a retrospective analysis of 60 patients who underwent surgery for extracranial high-risk chondrosarcoma, the use of RT as an adjunct to surgery (preoperative or postoperative) was associated with excellent and durable local control for tumors not amenable to wide surgical resection.97 A prospective outcomes study of patients with chondrosarcomas (n = 17) of the sacrum, cervical spine, and thoracolumbar spine found that high-dose external proton beam RT had a 4-year OS rate of 72% and more than half of patients (58%) had local Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

Treating patients with RT at the time of diagnosis is suggested to reduce the likelihood of local progression.98 Proton beam RT alone or in combination with photon beam RT has been associated with an excellent local tumor control and long-term survival in the treatment of patients with low-grade skull base and cervical spine chondrosarcomas.99-106 In two separate studies, proton beam RT resulted in local control rates of 92% and 94% in patients with skull base chondrosarcoma.99,103 Noel and colleagues reported a 3-year local control rate of 92% in 26 patients with chondrosarcoma of the skull base and upper cervical spine treated with surgical resection followed by a combination of proton and photon beam RT.102 In a larger series involving 229 patients with skull base chondrosarcomas, the combination of proton and photon beam RT resulted in 10-year local control rates of 94%.100 Carbon ion RT has also been reported to result in high local control rates in patients with skull base chondrosarcoma107,108 and patients with other unresectable chondrosarcomas.109 SRS has also been evaluated for adjuvant treatment of skull base chondrosarcoma.110 Systemic Therapy Chemotherapy is generally not effective in chondrosarcoma, particularly for the conventional and dedifferentiated subtypes. Mitchell and colleagues reported that adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and doxorubicin was associated with improved survival in patients with dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma.111 However, this finding could not be confirmed in other studies.112-114 A review of outcomes for 113 patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma reported that the addition of chemotherapy was associated with reduced risk of recurrence and death.115 Another report from the German study group confirmed that the outcome was better in younger patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma who received chemotherapy.116 In the absence of data from prospective randomized trials, the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of chondrosarcomas remains undefined. A multicenter, phase 2, single-arm study in patients with advanced sarcoma evaluated dasatinib, the small-molecule inhibitor of kinases (including SRC family, BCR-ABL, c-KIT, and platelet-derived growth factor receptors [PDGFRs] α and β). The Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC) coordinated this study, known as SARC009, which included three parallel trials focused on different rare sarcoma histologic types: aggressive sarcoma subtypes, indolent sarcoma subtypes, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The indolent substudy included patients with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic soft tissue or bone sarcoma, which included 33 patients with grade 1 or 2 chondrosarcoma.117 The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months using the Choi criteria, which for patients with chondrosarcoma was 47%, just below the 50% cutoff for an active agent. Six patients had objective tumor response and four patients (12%) had stable disease for more than 1 year, suggesting some tumor control. An editorial published in the same issue of Cancer compared results of this and other trials using different chemotherapies for chondrosarcoma and found improved PFS at 6 months with dasatinib.118 Similarly, pazopanib is an oral, multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic activity. A single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of pazopanib in 42 patients with unresectable or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma. The primary endpoint of the study was disease control rate (DCR) at week 16 and the secondary endpoints included PFS and OS. Overall, treatment with pazopanib resulted in a DCR of 43% at 16 weeks, a median PFS of 7.9 months, and a median OS of 17.6 months. Prior reports of the antitumor activity of pazopanib (including a case report and a small cohort study) in unresectable or metastatic chondrosarcoma are also favorable.58 Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-9 A multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and -expansion phase 1 trial in patients with IDH1-mutant advanced solid tumors, including 21 patients with advanced chondrosarcoma, evaluated the response to ivosidenib, a selective IDH1 inhibitor. Median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI, 1.9–7.4 months), PFS at 6 months was 39.5%, and 52% of patients had stable disease. All patients demonstrated decreased plasma 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) levels following treatment.119 Given these data, ivosidenib is included as a treatment option for patients with IDH1-mutant conventional or dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. NCCN Recommendations The histologic grade and tumor locations are the most important variables that determine the choice of primary treatment. Wide excision or intralesional excision with or without an adjuvant are the primary treatment options for patients with resectable low-grade and intracompartmental lesions.92,93 Wide excision is the preferred treatment option for patients with pelvic low-grade chondrosarcomas.84 High-grade (grade II, III), clear cell, or extracompartmental lesions, if resectable, should be treated with wide excision obtaining negative surgical margins.87 Wide excision should provide negative surgical margins and may be achieved by either limb-sparing surgery or amputation. Postoperative treatment with proton and/or photon beam RT may be useful for patients with tumors in an unfavorable location not amenable to resection, especially in chondrosarcomas of the skull base and axial skeleton.54,55 RT can be considered for patients with unresectable high- and low-grade lesions. However, since there are not enough data to support the use of RT in patients with chondrosarcoma, the panel has included this option as a category 2B recommendation. The guidelines suggest that patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcomas could be treated as per Ewing sarcoma, and those with dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas may be treated as osteosarcoma. Both of these options are included as category 2B recommendations. Dasatinib, pazopanib, and ivosidenib are included as category 2A recommendations for select patients with chondrosarcoma. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) or targeted exon sequencing can be used to detect IDH1 mutations, a prerequisite for ivosidenib treatment. Metastatic Disease Metastatic chondrosarcoma that is not dedifferentiated or mesenchymal either after recurrence or at presentation can be classified as oligometastatic or widespread disease. In general, patients with oligometastatic disease are amenable to local control (potentially rendering it disease free), such as with resection or RT, or treated as part of a clinical trial (goal is disease free/cure; more likely to proceed with surgery or radiation). Conversely, widespread disease cannot be treated by local resection or SBRT (goal is palliation). For oligometastatic disease that is resectable, NCCN recommends surgical excision of all sites of disease, if possible. For oligometastatic disease that is unresectable, consider RT that may include ablative therapy. For widespread disease, NCCN recommends considering RT, surgery, and/or ablative therapies for symptomatic sites, systemic therapy, or clinical trial. NCCN recommends that comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) with a validated and/or FDA-approved assay should be considered for patients with metastatic chondrosarcoma to identify potential targeted therapy opportunities.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-10 chest and primary site are recommended every 6 to 12 months for 2 years and then yearly as clinically indicated. Surveillance for high-grade lesions consists of a physical exam, radiographs of the primary site, and/or cross-sectional imaging (MRI or CT) as clinically indicated as well as chest imaging based on physician’s concern for risk of recurrence. Chest imaging should occur every 3 to 6 months (may include CT at least biannually) for the first 5 years and yearly thereafter for a minimum of 10 years as clinically indicated, as late metastases and recurrences after 5 years are more common with chondrosarcoma than with other sarcomas.78 Functional assessment should be performed at every visit. Relapsed Disease Local recurrence should be treated with wide excision if the lesions are resectable. RT (category 2B) or re-resection to achieve negative surgical margins should be considered following wide excision with positive surgical margins. Negative surgical margins should be observed. Unresectable recurrences are treated with RT (category 2B). A study in 25 patients demonstrated effective local control and low acute toxicity with carbon ion RT in patients with recurrent skull base chordoma or chondrosarcoma.120 Patients with systemic recurrence of a high-grade chondrosarcoma should follow the recommendations described above for Metastatic Disease. Chordoma Chordomas arise from the embryonic remnants of the notochord and are more common in older adults. Chordomas predominantly arise in the axial skeleton, with the sacrum (50%–60%), skull base (25%–35%), and spine (15%) being the most common primary sites.6,121 Chordomas are traditionally classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) into three histologic variants: conventional, chondroid, and dedifferentiated. Conventional chordomas are the most common histologic subtype characterized by the absence of cartilaginous or mesenchymal components. Chondroid chordomas present with histologic features of chordoma and cartilage elements, accounting for 5% to 15% of all chordomas. Dedifferentiated chordomas constitute about 2% to 8% of all chordomas and have features of high-grade pleomorphic spindle cell soft tissue sarcoma and an aggressive clinical course.121 More recently, an additional subset of chordoma has been identified in children. Poorly differentiated chordoma is characterized molecularly by the absence of SMARCB1 expression. The protein encoded by SMARCB1 is a chromatin remodeling agent and its absence is also implicated in the pathogenesis of some sarcomas, including but not limited to epithelioid sarcoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor, and epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). It is reported that poorly differentiated chordoma may be more common in the pediatric population and show a predilection for occurrence in the skull base and cervical spine. Although further research is warranted, poorly differentiated chordoma is considered to be more aggressive than either the conventional or chondroid variants with a poorer OS.122 Chordomas of the spine and sacrum present with localized deep pain or radiculopathies, whereas cervical chordomas can cause airway obstruction or dysphagia and might present as an oropharyngeal mass. Neurologic deficit is more often associated with chordomas of the skull base and mobile spine than chordomas of sacrococcygeal region.6 A review of 47 patients with skull base chordomas suggested that male sex was associated with worse PFS and OS.123 Workup Initial workup should include history and physical examination with adequate primary site imaging (ie, x-ray, MRI ± CT), screening MRI of spinal axis (MRI/CT with contrast), and chest/abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast. Skull base to mid-thigh PET/CT or bone scan (if PET/CT is negative) can be considered for unusual cases. Benign notochordal cell Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-11 tumors (BNCTs) are considered precursors to chordomas and do not require surgical management.124,125 CT and MRI may be useful in distinguishing BNCTs from chordomas.126,127 For skull base chordomas, CT is useful to delineate bone destruction and the presence of calcifications, whereas MRI is the modality of choice to define the tumor margin from brain, characterize the position and extension of tumors into the adjacent soft tissue structures, and visualize blood vessels.128,129 For sacrococcygeal chordomas, CT and MRI are useful to assess the soft tissue involvement, calcifications, and epidural extension.130-132 MRI provides more precise and superior contrast with surrounding soft tissues compared with CT and is helpful to assess recurrent or metastatic lesions.130,131 CT is also of particular importance to assess bony involvement, calcifications, and soft tissue and epidural extension of spinal chordomas, whereas MRI is the best imaging modality to detect tumor extension, cord compression, local recurrence, and residual tumor in the surgical scar tissue after surgical resection.133,134 CT is also useful in planning the reconstruction of the resistant osseous defect in tumors of the proximal sacrum. Treatment Surgery Wide excision with adequate margins is the preferred primary treatment for patients with chordoma.135,136 A retrospective analysis of 962 patients with chordoma identified in the SEER database demonstrated that surgery significantly improves OS.136 Several other reports have confirmed the prognostic significance of wide surgical margins, in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS, in patients with chordomas of the sacrum,137-140 skull base,141-147 and spine.139,148,149 Among patients with chordoma of the mobile spine, Boriani and colleagues reported that only margin-free en bloc resection was associated with continuous disease-free survival (DFS) with a follow-up of longer than 5 years; 12 of 18 patients were continuously disease-free at an average of 8 years after en bloc resection, whereas all patients who were treated with intralesional excision experienced recurrences in less than 2 years.148 In patients with chordomas of the sacrum and spine, Ruggieri and colleagues reported a local recurrence rate of only 17% following wide surgical margins compared to 81% following intralesional excision or marginal surgery. Tzortzidis and colleagues reported that aggressive microsurgical resection is associated with long-term, tumor-free survival with good functional outcome in patients with cranial base chordomas; gross total removal was achieved in 72% of patients resulting in local control rates of 50%.142 In a 10-year meta-analysis that included 802 patients with skull base chordoma, Di Maio and colleagues reported that patients with incomplete resection were 3.83 times more likely to experience a recurrence at 5 years than patients with complete resection.145,146 In a meta-analysis of 33 noncomparative studies evaluating the management of sacrococcygeal chordomas, the overall mortality rate was found to be lowest with surgical resection followed by adjuvant RT (16%) when compared to either surgical resection (28%) or RT (43%) alone. Additionally, the PFS at 60-month follow-up was higher after surgical resection with adjuvant RT (74%) than when compared to only surgery (55%) or only RT (36%).150 Radiation Therapy RT (preoperative, postoperative, or intraoperative) is used in combination with surgery to improve local control and DFS for patients with resectable chordomas. Various retrospective studies and case series have demonstrated improved local control and DFS with combined surgical/RT approaches for treating spinal/sacral98,105,151-155 and clival/skull base chordomas.141,153,156-160 A meta-analysis of 464 patients with cranial chordoma revealed a recurrence rate of 68% with an average/median DFS of 23 and 45 months, respectively.158 Patient subsets with decreased recurrence rates included younger patients, those with chondroid-type chordoma, and patients who received surgery and adjuvant RT.

The 8-year actuarial risk of grades 3–4 RT toxicity was 13%.105 A subsequent retrospective review of 126 patients with spinal/sacral chordoma who received high-dose proton therapy revealed 5-year OS and local control of 81% and 62%, respectively.152 A retrospective analysis of 40 patients with unresected chordoma treated with photon/proton RT showed a 5-year local control rate and OS of 85.4% and 81.9%, respectively.172 Similarly, a phase I/phase II trial with 20 patients confirmed to have non-metastatic chordoma or chondrosarcoma treated with proton RT also reported favorable results with a 3-year local control rate of 86% and a PFS of 81%.173 A meta-analysis of 25 studies evaluating the 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS rates of conformal RT (CRT), SRT, proton therapy, and carbon-ion therapy found that the OS rates were higher for SRT, proton therapy, and carbon-ion therapy when compared to CRT.174 Specialized techniques such as IMRT and SRS/SRT have also been associated with good local control rates in cranial as well as extracranial chordomas.106,175-179 Systemic Therapy Chordomas are not sensitive to chemotherapy except for the potentially dedifferentiated portion of high-grade dedifferentiated chordomas.180 Several signal transduction pathways including PDGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chordomas, leading to the development of targeted therapies.181,182 In a phase II trial of 56 patients with advanced chordoma treated with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 70% of patients had stable disease. The clinical benefit rate (CBR) as determined by RECIST criteria (complete response + partial response and stable disease ≥6 months) was 64%, and the median PFS in the intention-to-treat population was 9 months.36 Imatinib in combination with cisplatin or sirolimus has also been effective in a small series of patients with advanced chordoma resistant to prior imatinib therapy.183,184 A retrospective study of imatinib in advanced, progressive, and inoperable chordoma achieved stable disease in 74% of patients, with a median PFS of 9.9 months.185 The efficacy of EGFR inhibitors such as erlotinib and lapatinib has also been demonstrated in patients with advanced chordoma resistant to imatinib.186-188 In a phase II study of 18 patients with locally advanced and metastatic chordoma, lapatinib induced partial response in 33% of patients and 39% of patients had stable disease, based on Choi response criteria, whereas all patients had stable disease based on RECIST criteria.188 The median PFS was 6 months and 8 months (with a CBR of 22%) based on Choi and RECIST criteria, respectively. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is included as a systemic therapy option based on data from a phase II trial in 27 patients with advanced/metastatic chordoma. In this trial, the intent-to-treat best objective response was 1/27 (3.7%; 95% CI, 0.1%–19.0%), 9-month PFS was 73.0% (95% CI, 46.1–88.0), and 12-month OS was 86.5% (95% CI, 55.8–96.5).189,190 Dasatinib is also included as a systemic therapy option based on data from the SARC009 indolent substudy that included 32 patients with Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-13 unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic chordoma.117 The primary endpoint was PFS at 6 months using the Choi criteria, which for patients with chordoma was 54%. For patients with chordoma, the median PFS was 6.3 months and the 5-year OS was 18%. The authors also compared reported patient outcomes in selected phase 2 studies in patients with chordomas and no substantial differences in overall response rate (ORR), median PFS, or 6-months PFS compared with imatinib or lapatinib treatment. The inclusion of sunitinib in the guidelines is based on data from a phase II study in which 44% (4/9) of patients with advanced chordoma treated with sunitinib achieved stable disease for at least 16 weeks.191 NCCN Recommendations Tumor location is the most important variable in determining the choice of primary treatment for patients with conventional or chondroid chordomas. Dedifferentiated and poorly differentiated chordomas are usually managed as described in the NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma. Wide excision with or without RT is the primary treatment option for patients with resectable conventional or chondroid chordomas of the sacrum and mobile spine.135,136 Intralesional excision with or without RT (followed by MRI to assess the adequacy of resection) is the treatment of choice for patients with resectable skull base tumors of conventional or chondroid histology. Maximal safe resection is recommended when appropriate.144 Adjuvant treatment with RT can be considered for large extra-compartmental tumors or for positive surgical margins following resection. Postoperative RT has been associated with improved local control and DFS following surgery with macroscopic surgical margins or intralesional excision.151,153,158,192,193 Re-resection, if necessary, can be considered for skull base tumors with positive surgical margins. RT is the primary treatment option for patients with unresectable chordomas, irrespective of the location of the tumor. Surveillance Surveillance consists of a physical exam, imaging (ie, x-ray, MRI with contrast ± CT with contrast) of the primary site (timing and modality as clinically indicated) for up to 10 years, and chest imaging (every 6 months for 5 years and annually thereafter; may include CT annually; chest CT may be done with or without contrast as clinically indicated). Relapsed Disease Chordomas are characterized by a high rate of local recurrence, and distant metastases to lungs, bone, soft tissue, lymph nodes, liver, and skin have been reported in up to 40% of patients with local recurrence.137,161,194,195 Among patients with recurrent chordomas of skull base and spine, Fagundes and colleagues reported a higher 2-year actuarial OS rate for patients treated with subtotal resection than those who received supportive care only (63% and 21%, respectively; P = .001).161 However, some studies have reported that surgery and RT are associated with lower local control rates for recurrent tumors than for primary tumors in patients with sacral chordomas.163,177 A study in 25 patients demonstrated effective local control and low acute toxicity with carbon ion RT in patients with recurrent skull base chordoma or chondrosarcoma.120 Patients with recurrent disease can be treated with surgery and/or RT196 and/or systemic therapy. The guidelines include imatinib (with or without cisplatin or sirolimus), dasatinib, sunitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib (for patients with EGFR-positive disease), and sorafenib as systemic therapy options for patients with recurrent tumors. CGP with a validated and/or FDA-approved assay should be considered for patients with recurrent chordoma to determine targeted therapy opportunities. Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-14 Ewing Sarcoma Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the fusion of the EWS gene (EWSR1) on chromosome 22q12 with various members of the ETS gene family (FLI1, ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and FEV).8,9 The EWS::FLI1 fusion transcript resulting from the fusion of EWS and FLI1 on chromosome 11 and the corresponding chromosomal translocation, t(11;22)(q24;q12), is identified in about 85% of patients with Ewing sarcoma.8 In 5% to 10% of cases, EWS is fused with other members of the ETS gene family. In rare cases, FUS can substitute for EWS resulting in fusion transcripts with no EWS rearrangement [FUS::ERG fusion transcript resulting from the translocation t(16;21)(p11;q24) or FUS::FEV fusion transcript resulting from the translocation t(2;16)(q35;p11)].197,198 Overall, 90% of Ewing sarcomas will have one of four cytogenetic translocations. Ewing sarcoma is also characterized by the strong expression of cell surface glycoprotein MIC2 (CD99).199,200 The expression of MIC2 may be useful in the differential diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) from other small round-cell neoplasms, although it is not exclusively specific to these tumors.201 Similar in morphology with various molecular signatures, Ewing-like sarcomas are a heterogenous group of tumors that namely affect the pediatric and adolescent population.202 Ewing-like tumors have been divided into three main categories based on cytogenetics: CIC-rearranged sarcomas (eg, CIC::DUX4), BCOR-rearranged sarcomas, and round cell sarcomas with EWSR1 fusions with non-ETS genes.203 Typically, Ewing sarcoma occurs in AYAs. The most common primary sites are the pelvic bones, femur, and the bones of the chest wall, although any bone may be affected.20 When arising in a long bone, the diaphysis is the most frequently affected site. On imaging, the bone appears mottled. Periosteal reaction is classic and it is referred to as “onion skin” by radiologists. Patients with Ewing sarcoma, as with most patients with bone sarcomas, seek attention because of localized pain or swelling. Unlike other bone sarcomas, constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue are occasionally noted at presentation. Abnormal laboratory studies may include elevated serum LDH and leukocytosis. Prognostic Factors The important indicators of favorable prognosis include a distal/peripheral site of primary disease, tumor volume less than 100 mL, normal LDH level at presentation, and the absence of metastatic disease at the time of presentation.204-210 Ewing sarcoma in the spine and sacrum is associated with significantly worse outcome and prognosis than primary Ewing sarcoma in other sites.211 In a systematic review, Bosma and colleagues also reported tumor size (diameter >8 cm) and histologic response (≥90% necrosis) to be important prognostic variables.212 Nevertheless, metastatic disease at presentation is the most significant adverse prognostic factor in Ewing sarcoma, as it is for other bone sarcomas.23,208,213 The lungs, bone, and bone marrow are the most common sites of metastasis. In a retrospective analysis of 975 patients from the EICESS Study Group, 5-year RFS was 22% for patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis compared with 55% for patients without metastases at diagnosis.23 Among patients with metastases, there was a trend for better survival for those with lung metastases compared to those with bone metastases or a combination of lung and bone metastases.23 Metastases to uncommon sites (ie, brain, liver, spleen) were associated with a worse prognosis in a retrospective study of 30 patients.214 Poor histologic/radiologic response to chemotherapy has also been identified as an adverse prognostic factor in patients with localized non-metastatic disease,207,215,216 even when chemotherapy was followed by R0 resection.217 The results of the IESS study analyzing the clinicopathologic features of 303 cases of Ewing sarcoma showed that patients with primary tumors in Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-15 pelvic bones have lower survival rates compared with patients with lesions in distal bones of the extremities.218 In an analysis of 53 patients (24 adult and 29 pediatric) with Ewing sarcoma treated with chemotherapy, Gupta and colleagues identified pelvic disease and time to local therapy as significant prognostic factors associated with EFS in a multivariate analysis.219 In another retrospective analysis of patients with Ewing sarcoma from a large population-based cancer registry, Lee and colleagues determined that adult age, Hispanic ancestry, metastatic disease, large tumor size, and low socioeconomic status are poor prognostic factors for OS.220 Workup If Ewing sarcoma is suspected as a diagnosis, the patient should undergo complete staging prior to biopsy. This should include CT of the chest with or without contrast as clinically indicated; MRI with or without CT (both with contrast) of the primary site; head-to-toe PET/CT and/or bone scan; and possibly bone marrow biopsy and/or screening MRI of the spine and pelvis. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Treglia and colleagues reported that the combination of PET/CT with conventional imaging is a valuable tool for the staging and restaging of Ewing sarcoma, with 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity.221 Another systematic review indicated that 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET without bone marrow biopsy may be considered for staging in newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma patients, as FDG-PET demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity based on pooled patient data from four studies.222 Results from ACRIN 6660, a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) comparing whole-body MRI and conventional imaging in pediatric patients with common malignant tumors (including Ewing sarcoma), found that the noninferior accuracy for diagnosis of distant metastasis was not established for the use of whole-body MRI compared with conventional imaging.223 However, the accuracy of whole-body MRI was higher for patients with solid tumors compared to those with lymphomas (P = .006). Cytogenetic and/or molecular studies of the biopsy specimen should be performed to evaluate the t(11;22) translocation. CGP has also been used to identify potentially actionable translocations in patients with sarcoma.224,225 In the case that pathologic workup of targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or cytogenetics is negative, CGP or other fusion panels for Ewing sarcoma should be considered to identify translocations. Preliminary reports suggest that EWS::FLI1 translocation is associated with a better prognosis than other variants.226-228 However, reports from the EURO-EWING 99 study and the Children’s Oncology Group study suggest that with currently available effective therapies, patients with Ewing sarcoma have similar outcomes, regardless of fusion subtype in contrast to previous reports.229,230 In addition to EWS, FUS should be considered as a fusion gene partner in the molecular diagnosis to identify the rare cases of Ewing sarcoma with FUS::ERG or FUS::FEV fusion transcripts.197,198 Since serum LDH has been shown to have prognostic value as a tumor marker, the guidelines have included this test as part of initial evaluation. Fertility consultation should be considered as appropriate. Treatment Chemotherapy Multiagent chemotherapy regimens including vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide have been shown to be effective in patients with localized Ewing sarcoma in single- as well as multi-institution collaborative trials in the United States and Europe. Multiagent chemotherapy for at least 9 weeks is recommended prior to surgery to downstage the tumor and increase the Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM. For personal use only.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-16 probability of achieving a complete resection with microscopically negative margins. Adjuvant chemotherapy following surgical resection improves RFS and OS in a majority of patients.231-235 Surgical resection with or without RT is used for local control following chemotherapy. The addition of ifosfamide, alone or in combination with etoposide to standard chemotherapy, was evaluated in patients with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic Ewing sarcoma.233,236-240 In the Pediatric Oncology Group-Children’s Cancer Group (POG-CCG) study (INT-0091), 398 patients with non-metastatic Ewing sarcoma were randomized to receive chemotherapy with VACD (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) alone or VACD alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide (VACD-IE) for a total of 17 cycles.233 The 5-year EFS rate was significantly higher in the VACD-IE group than in the VACD alone group (69% and 54%, respectively; P = .005). The 5-year OS rate was also significantly better among patients in the VACD-IE group (72% and 61%, respectively; P = .01). VACD-IE also was associated with lower incidences of local failure (11%) compared with VACD (30%) irrespective of the type of local control therapy; 5-year cumulative incidences of local failure were 30% in the VACD arm compared with 11% in the VACD-IE arm.241 While dose escalation of alkylating agents in the VDC (vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide)-IE regimen did not improve the outcome for patients with localized disease,242 chemotherapy intensification through interval compression improved outcome in patients with localized disease.243 In a randomized trial for patients <50 years with localized Ewing sarcoma (n = 568), Womer and colleagues reported that VDC-IE given on an every-2-week schedule was found to be more effective than VDC-IE given on an every-3-week schedule, with no increase in toxicity; median 5-year EFS was 73% and 65%, respectively.243 The Euro Ewing 2012 (EE2012) was a randomized analysis conducted to compare the induction and consolidation regimens for newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma in both the United States and Europe. Six hundred forty patients between the ages of 5 to 50 years were randomized to two treatment arms, A and B. Treatment arm A received the European regimen: VIDE (vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide) induction therapy followed by VAI (vincristine, dactinomycin, and ifosfamide) or VAC consolidation. Treatment arm B received the U.S. regimen: compressed VDC/IE induction followed by IE/VC consolidation. The primary endpoint of the study was PFS while the secondary endpoints were OS and toxicity. The VDC/IE regimen proved superior to the European regimen in terms of PFS and OS with similar toxicity profiles.244 IESS-I and IESS-II showed that RT plus adjuvant chemotherapy with VACD was superior to VAC in patients with localized non-metastatic disease.232 The 5-year RFS rates were 60% and 24% for VACD and VAC, respectively (P < .001). The corresponding OS rates were 65% and 28% (P < .001). In the INT-0091 study, which included 120 patients with metastatic disease, there was no significant difference, however, in the EFS and OS rates between the VACD-IE and VACD regimens.233 The 5-year EFS rate was 22% for both regimens and the 5-year OS rate was 34% and 35% for the VACD-IE and VACD groups, respectively. In a study of 68 patients (44 patients with locoregional disease and 24 patients with distant metastases), Kolb and colleagues reported 4-year EFS and OS rates of 82% and 89%, respectively, for patients with locoregional disease treated with intensive chemotherapy (doxorubicin and vincristine with or without high-dose cyclophosphamide) followed by ifosfamide and etoposide.238 In patients with distant metastases the corresponding survival rates were 12% and 18%, respectively.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-17 findings in patients with Ewing sarcoma or PNET of bone with metastases at diagnosis.245 The EICESS-92 study investigated whether cyclophosphamide has a similar efficacy as ifosfamide in patients with standard-risk Ewing sarcoma (small localized tumors) and whether the addition of etoposide to a regimen already containing ifosfamide improves survival in patients with high-risk disease (large tumors or metastatic disease at diagnosis).246 Patients with standard-risk disease were randomly assigned to VAIA (vincristine, dactinomycin, ifosfamide, and doxorubicin; n = 76) followed by either VAIA or VACA (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin; n = 79).246 The 3-year EFS rates were 73% and 74%, respectively, for VACA and VAIA, suggesting that cyclophosphamide has the same efficacy as ifosfamide in this group of patients. Patients with high-risk disease were randomly assigned to VAIA or VAIA plus etoposide (EVAIA). The 3-year EFS rate was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (52% and 47%, respectively, for EVAIA and VAIA). However, there was some evidence that the addition of etoposide was associated with a greater survival benefit in the subgroup of patients without metastases (P = .18) than in those with metastases (P = .84).246 As a follow-up to the EICESS-92 study, the Euro-EWING99-R1 trial evaluated cyclophosphamide as a replacement for ifosfamide as a part of consolidation therapy that also included vincristine and dactinomycin (VAC vs. VAI) after VIDE induction chemotherapy in 856 patients with standard-risk Ewing sarcoma. VAC was statistically not inferior to VAI, but was associated with a slight increase in events (-2.8% decrease in 3-year EFS). The proportion of patients experiencing severe hematologic toxicity was slightly higher in the VAC arm, but renal tubular function impairment was more significant for patients receiving VAI.247 High-Dose Therapy Followed by Hematopoietic Cell Transplant High-dose therapy followed by hematopoietic cell transplant (HDT/HCT) has been evaluated in patients with localized as well as metastatic disease. HDT/HCT has been associated with potential survival benefit in patients with non-metastatic disease.248,249 However, studies that have evaluated HDT/HCT in patients with primary metastatic disease have shown conflicting results.250-256 The EURO-EWING 99 study was the first large randomized trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiagent induction chemotherapy with six courses of VIDE, local treatment (surgery and/or RT), and HDT/HCT in 281 patients with Ewing sarcoma with primary disseminated disease.251 After a median follow-up of 3.8 years, the EFS and OS rates at 3 years for the entire study cohort were 27% and 34%, respectively.255 The EFS rates were 57% and 25%, respectively, for patients with complete and partial response after HDT/HCT. Patient’s age, tumor volume, and extent of metastatic spread were identified as relevant risk factors. The outcome of patients with and without HDT/HCT was not performed because of the bias introduced early in the non-transplant group (82% of patients without HDT/HCT died after a median time of 1 year). The EURO-EWING 99 and Ewing-2008 randomized trial asked whether consolidation high-dose chemotherapy improved survival in patients with localized Ewing sarcoma.256 Two hundred forty high-risk patients were randomly assigned to receive seven VAI courses (n = 118) or one course of busulfan and melphalan (BuMel) HDT with autologous HCT (n = 122), after a VIDE six-course induction plus one VAI consolidation course. Patients were followed for 15 years; median follow-up time was 7.8 years. BuMel-treated patients had greater improvement in 3-year EFS (69.0% vs. 56.7%) and 8-year EFS (60.7% vs. 47.1%) compared to VAI-treated patients.

Local Control Therapy Surgery and RT are the local control treatment modalities used for patients with localized disease, but no randomized trials have compared these approaches head-to-head. In patients with localized Ewing sarcoma treated in cooperative intergroup studies there was no significant effect of local control modality (surgery, RT, or surgery plus RT) on OS or EFS rates.241,257 In the CESS 86 trial, although radical surgery and resection plus RT resulted in better local control rates (100% and 95%, respectively) than definitive RT (86%), there was no improvement in RFS or OS because of higher frequency of metastases after surgery.257 In the INT-0091 study, the incidences of local failure were similar for patients treated with surgery or RT alone (25%), but surgery plus RT resulted in lower incidences of local failure (10.5%).241 The 5-year EFS rate was also not significantly different between the groups (42%, 52%, and 47% for patients treated with surgery, RT, and surgery plus RT, respectively). Data from other retrospective analyses suggest that surgery (with or without postoperative RT) affords better local control than RT alone in patients with localized disease.258,259 The combined analysis of 1058 patients treated in the CESS 81, CESS 86, and EICESS 92 trials showed that the rate of local failure was significantly lower after surgery (with or without postoperative RT) than after definitive RT (7.5% vs. 26.3%, respectively; P = .001), whereas the local control rate with preoperative RT was comparable to that of the surgery group (5.3%).258 The most recent retrospective analysis of sequential studies (INT-0091, INT-0154, or AEWS0031) performed by the Children’s Oncology Group also demonstrated that definitive RT was associated with a higher risk of local failure than surgery plus RT, but there was no effect on distant failure.259 Definitive RT could be an effective treatment option for patients with tumors in anatomical locations not amenable to achieve surgery with wider resection margins.260,261 In a retrospective analysis of patients with Ewing sarcoma of vertebrae treated in the CESS 81/86 and EICESS 92 studies, definitive RT resulted in a local control rate of 22.6%, which was comparable to those of other tumor sites treated with definitive RT; EFS and OS at 5 years were 47% and 58%, respectively.260 Tumor size and RT dose have been shown to be predictive of local control rates in patients with non-metastatic Ewing sarcoma treated with chemotherapy and definitive RT.262,263 Local control therapy has also been associated with improved outcomes in patients with primary metastatic disease.264-266 In the EURO-EWING 99 trial, the 3-year EFS was significantly lower in patients with primary metastatic disease who did not receive any local control therapy compared to those treated with local therapy for primary tumor.264 Retrospective analysis of 198 patients from EURO-EWING 99 showed no improvement of 5-year EFS associated with adjuvant RT in the setting of completely resected disease of the chest wall.267 NCCN Recommendations All patients with Ewing sarcoma should be treated with the following protocol: primary treatment followed by local control therapy and adjuvant treatment. Primary treatment consists of multiagent chemotherapy along with appropriate growth factor support for at least 9 weeks (category 1). Longer duration could be considered for patients with metastatic disease based on response. VDC/IE (vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide) is the preferred regimen for patients with localized disease and is a category 1 recommendation. See Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents in the algorithm for a list of other chemotherapy regimens that are recommended for patients with localized and metastatic disease.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-19 Disease should be restaged with imaging following primary treatment. Chest imaging should be performed with CT (with or without contrast as clinically indicated) and primary site imaging should include MRI with or without CT (both with contrast) and plain radiograph. Head-to-toe PET/CT and/or bone scan can be used for restaging depending on the imaging technique that was used in the initial workup. Patients with stable or improved disease after primary treatment should be treated with local control therapy. Local control options include wide excision, definitive RT with chemotherapy, or amputation in selected cases.258,260,262,264 The choice of local control therapy should be individualized and is dependent on tumor location, size, response to chemotherapy, patient’s age, anticipated morbidity, and patient preference.241 Adjuvant chemotherapy following wide excision or amputation is recommended for all patients regardless of surgical margins. The panel strongly recommends that the duration of chemotherapy following wide excision or amputation should be between 28 and 49 weeks depending on the type of regimen and the dosing schedule (category 1).231-233 The addition of postoperative RT to chemotherapy is recommended for patients with positive or very close surgical margins.258 Denbo and colleagues reported that in patients with smaller tumor size (<8 cm) and negative margins, postoperative RT can be omitted without any decrement in OS.268 The 15-year estimated OS for patients who received adjuvant RT was 80% compared to 100% for those who did not. The guidelines have included adjuvant chemotherapy alone for patients treated with wide excision and negative margins. In the setting of widely metastatic disease, palliative therapies may be considered. For metastatic disease that may be amenable to local therapy, local control modalities, in the form of wide excision or definitive RT with adjuvant chemotherapy, are recommended. Regardless of postoperative margin status, chemotherapy for at least 28 to 49 weeks is to be administered (category 1). RT may be considered for positive surgical margins. Following adjuvant treatment, metastases may be managed according to the location. In the case of oligometastatic disease, resection or RT is recommended. STS/SBRT can be considered, especially for oligometastases.269-271 For pulmonary metastases, dependent on the response, resection or whole lung irradiation (WLI) may be considered. Based on the EORTC-SIOP phase III study published in 1988, which concluded there to be no survival benefit of WLI over adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with osteosarcoma, a systematic review of both prophylactic as well as curative WLI in patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma was conducted.272,273 Only two studies compared the results of chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy and curative WLI in patients with metastatic Ewing sarcoma. In both trials, patients reported some benefit with WLI and chemotherapy when compared to chemotherapy alone. For instance, in the EICESS-92 trial, patients who also received WLI showed a 12% improvement in 5-year OS.273,274 Ultimately, it was concluded that the decision to use WLI should be based on the patient’s risk of pulmonary metastases and any coexisting respiratory diseases.273 Progressive disease following primary treatment is best managed with RT and/or surgery to primary site followed by chemotherapy or best supportive care. Surveillance Surveillance of patients with Ewing sarcoma should include a physical exam, CBC and other laboratory studies, and cross-sectional imaging (MRI with or without CT) and plain radiographs of the primary site. Chest imaging (x-ray or CT) is recommended every 2 to 3 months. Head-to-toe PET/CT or bone scan can be considered. Surveillance intervals should be increased after 2 years. Long-term surveillance should be performed annually after 5 years (indefinitely) as clinically indicated (category 2B).275 Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM. For personal use only.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-20 Relapsed or Refractory Disease About 30% to 40% of patients with Ewing sarcoma experience recurrence (local and/or distant) and have a very poor prognosis. Patients with a longer time to first recurrence have a better chance of survival following recurrence. Late relapse (≥2 years from the time of original diagnosis), lung-only metastases, local recurrence that can be treated with radical surgery, and intensive chemotherapy are the most favorable prognostic factors, whereas early relapse (<2 years from the time of original diagnosis) with metastases in lungs and/or other sites, recurrence at local and distant sites, elevated LDH at initial diagnosis, and initial recurrence are considered adverse prognostic factors.276-279 In a retrospective analysis, site of first relapse and time to first relapse were significant prognostic factors for adult patients with localized Ewing sarcoma.280 The probability of 5-year post-relapse survival was 55% and 22%, respectively, for patients with local and distant relapse. The probability of 5-year post-relapse survival was also significantly higher for patients with late relapse than for those with early relapse.23,280,281 Overall, it is reported that close to 70% of relapses are early relapses, of which two-thirds occur at distant sites (in the lungs and/or bones). Patients who initially presented with widespread disease are more likely to relapse at distant sites, whereas those individuals who presented with localized disease are more likely to develop local relapse.282 Topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in combination with cyclophosphamide and temozolomide have been associated with favorable response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory bone sarcomas.283-289 In a series of 54 patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma, cyclophosphamide and topotecan induced responses in 44% of patients (35% of patients had a complete response and 9% had a partial response).284 After a median follow-up of 23 months, 26% of patients were in continuous remission. In a retrospective analysis of patients with recurrent or progressive Ewing sarcoma, irinotecan and temozolomide resulted in an overall ORR of 63%. The median time to progression (TTP) for all the evaluable patients (n = 20) was 8.3 months (16.2 months for the subset of patients with recurrent disease).287 Patients who were in a 2-year first remission and those with primary localized disease had better median TTP compared to those who relapsed within 2 years from diagnosis and patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis. Combination therapy with vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide also appears to be active and well-tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma, with an ORR of 68.1%.290 A review of 107 patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma examined the combination of etoposide with a platinum agent (ie, cisplatin or carboplatin), suggesting that further study of etoposide/carboplatin may be warranted.291 HDT/HCT has been associated with improved long-term survival in patients with relapsed or progressive Ewing sarcoma in small, single-institution studies.292-294 The role of this approach is yet to be determined in prospective randomized studies. The CABONE trial, a multicenter, single-arm phase 2 trial, evaluated the activity of cabozantinib in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma.295 Currently approved for renal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and medullary thyroid cancer, cabozantinib is a VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with inhibitory activity against the MET receptor. For Ewing sarcoma, the primary endpoint in this study was a 6-month objective response, while the secondary endpoints included safety, 6-month non-progression, best overall response, 1-year and 2-year PFS and OS, and metabolic response (evaluated by 18F-FDG-PET/CT 28 days after the first dose). The primary endpoint was reached with a 6-month objective response of 26% (95% CI, 13–42) among 39 patients with Ewing sarcoma. Additionally, the median OS was reported to be 10.2 months with a median PFS of 4.4 months. OS was noted to be 84% at 6 months, 48% at 12 months, and finally 14% at 24 months.

Lastly, cabozantinib was found to be well-tolerated among patients with the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects being hypophosphatemia, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), palmar-plantar syndrome, pneumothorax, and neutropenia.295 Docetaxel in combination with gemcitabine was well-tolerated, resulting in an overall ORR of 29% in children and young adults with refractory bone sarcomas; median duration of response was 4.8 months.296 The combination of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory bone sarcomas297 A recent single-arm phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of lurbinectedin in a cohort of 28 adult patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma.298 Treatment with lurbinectedin resulted in an ORR of 14.3% and a median DOR of 4.2 months. In a study evaluating 26 patients treated for local recurrence of Ewing sarcoma, surgical treatment was associated with better survival (P < .001).299 In addition to chemotherapy, surgery may be a treatment option for some patients who experience relapse. NCCN Recommendations Treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory disease include participation in a clinical trial and chemotherapy (with or without RT or with or without surgery). See Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents in the algorithm for a list of other chemotherapy regimens recommended for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. All patients with recurrent and metastatic disease should be considered for clinical trials investigating new treatment approaches. Giant Cell Tumor of Bone GCTB is a rare benign primary tumor of the bone accounting for about 3% to 5% of all primary bone tumors, with a strong tendency for local recurrence and that may metastasize to the lungs.300,301 GCTB usually occurs between 20 and 40 years of age. The meta-epiphyseal regions of the distal femur and proximal tibia are the most common primary sites.302 Malignant transformation to high-grade osteosarcoma has been observed in rare cases and is associated with a poor prognosis.303,304 Workup Initial workup should include history and physical examination with imaging (ie, x-ray, MRI with contrast ± CT) of the primary site as clinically indicated, in addition to chest imaging. CT is useful to define the extent of cortical destruction, whereas MRI is the preferred imaging modality to assess the extension of tumors into the adjacent soft tissue and neurovascular structures.305,306 Chest imaging is essential to identify the presence of metastatic disease. Bone scan can be considered for unusual cases. Biopsy is essential to confirm the diagnosis. Brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism should be considered as a differential diagnosis; routine evaluation of serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone levels can help exclude this diagnosis.307 If there is malignant transformation, treat as osteosarcoma. Treatment Surgery Wide excision and intralesional curettage are the two surgical treatment options for patients with resectable tumors.308-314 Wide excision is associated with a lower risk of local recurrence than intralesional curettage, with the local recurrence rates ranging from 0% to 12% for wide excision and 12% to 65% for intralesional curettage. In some studies, the extent of intralesional excision and the tumor stage have been identified as prognostic indicators for risk of recurrence.315-317 Blackley and Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-22 colleagues reported a local recurrence rate of 12% in 59 patients who were treated with curettage with high-speed burr and bone grafting, which was similar to that observed with the use of adjuvants; the majority of the patients had grade II or III tumors.316 In another retrospective analysis of 137 patients, Prosser and colleagues reported local recurrences in 19% of patients following curettage as a primary treatment; local recurrence rate was only 7% for patients with grade I and II tumors confined to the bone compared with 29% for those with grade III tumors with extraosseous extension.317 Surgical adjuvants have been used in conjunction with intralesional curettage to improve local control rates. However, the findings from studies that have evaluated intralesional curettage, with and without adjuvant in the same cohort of patients with primary or recurrent GCTB, are inconsistent, with some reporting decreased local recurrence rates with the use of adjuvants.312,318-321 Others, however, have reported no significant difference in local recurrence rates with and without adjuvants.138,322,323 Wide excision is also associated with poor functional outcome and greater surgical complications.324-328 Therefore, intralesional curettage is considered the treatment of choice in a majority of patients with stage I or II tumors. Wide excision is usually reserved for more aggressive stage III tumors with extraosseous extension or otherwise unresectable tumors.317,329-332 Radiation Therapy RT has been used either as a primary treatment or in combination with surgery to improve local control and DFS for patients with marginally resected, unresectable, progressive, or recurrent disease.333-344 In a retrospective analysis of 58 patients with GCTB (45 patients with primary tumor and 13 patients with recurrent tumor) treated with RT, the 5-year local control and OS rates were 85% and 94%, respectively.343 Median follow-up was 8 years. In this analysis, patient age was the only prognostic factor with local control rates (96% for younger patients vs. 73% for the older group) as well as OS (100% vs. 87%) and DFS rates (96% vs. 65%). Other studies have identified tumor size greater than 4 cm, recurrent tumors, and RT doses of 40 Gy or less as negative prognostic factors for local control.339-341,344 Specialized techniques such as 3D-CRT and IMRT have also been associated with good local control rates in patients with GCTB in locations that are not amenable to complete surgical resection.345,346 Adverse side effects have occurred from RT. As GCTB is a benign growth, radiation use should be considered riskier than for malignant tumors. Therefore, the panel recommends that RT should be considered if no other treatment options are available, if possible. Systemic Therapy Denosumab (a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against the RANK ligand) has demonstrated activity in patients with unresectable or recurrent GCTB.347-353 In June 2013, denosumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with GCTB that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity. Several phase II trials have examined the efficacy of denosumab for treating primary and recurrent GCTB. In an open-label, phase II study (n = 37), denosumab induced tumor response (defined as the elimination of at least 90% of giant cells or no radiologic progression of the target lesion for up to 25 weeks) in 86% (30 of 35 evaluable patients) of patients with unresectable or recurrent GCTB.347 An open-label, parallel-group, phase II study divided patients with GCTB into three cohorts: those with unresectable GCTB (cohort 1), those with resectable GCTB associated with severe surgical morbidity (cohort 2), and those transferred from a Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-23 previous study of denosumab for GCTB (cohort 3).349,354 After a median follow-up of 13 months, 96% of evaluable patients (163 of 169) in cohort 1 had no disease progression.349 Clinically significant reductions in pain were reported by over half of the study patients within 2 months.355 Final analysis of outcomes from cohort 2 (n = 222) showed that denosumab enabled 48% of patients to delay/avoid surgery and 38% to undergo less morbid resections. The risk of local recurrence has been reported to be higher when denosumab is used prior to curettage. In a retrospective analysis of 408 patients treated for GCTB using either intralesional curettage or wide excision, the local recurrence rate for patients treated with curettage and denosumab was 60%, compared to 16% for those individuals treated with curettage alone.356 Additionally, the joint preservation rate of patients treated with curettage and denosumab was 80% compared to 94% for those treated with curettage alone. Although denosumab usage was reported to be the only independent factor associated with increased recurrence, it is likely that such an association may also stem from selection bias.356 Use of denosumab before surgery, however, may aid in defining a peripheral rim around the tumor.357,358 Phase II trial data have also suggested that sequential FDG-PET imaging appears to be a sensitive tool for early detection of tumor response to denosumab treatment.359 There have been reports of increased risk of developing osteosarcoma associated with denosumab therapy.360,361 The data are limited to determine the cause of the increased risk, but the NCCN Panel identifies some possibilities, such as spontaneous conversion to a secondary sarcoma, or a diagnostic and/or sampling error that erroneously categorizes a tumor as GCTB. In prior versions of the guidelines, interferon (IFN) was recommended as a treatment option, based on case reports that reported the efficacy of IFN in the management of GCTB.362-365 However, since IFN is no longer available in the United States, it has been removed as a treatment option in the guidelines. NCCN Recommendations Localized Disease Intralesional excision with an effective adjuvant may be an adequate primary treatment for resectable tumors.138,322,323 Serial arterial embolizations have been shown to be effective in the comprehensive care of patients with giant cell tumors of the extremities, especially for tumors with large cortical defects or joint involvement and for those with large giant cell tumors of the sacrum.366-369 For patients with lesions that are resectable with unacceptable morbidity and/or unresectable axial lesions, the guidelines have included denosumab and/or serial embolization as preferred options. Consultation with a dentist should be considered prior to initiating denosumab therapy.370 RT is another recommended option, although it may be associated with an increased risk of malignant transformation. Imaging should be used to assess treatment response and should include plain radiographs as well as CT with or without MRI (both with contrast). Following primary treatment, patients with stable/improved disease can be observed. For patients with stable/improved disease with incomplete healing following primary treatment, excision is recommended if the lesion has become resectable. Long-term denosumab use may be associated with increased risk of local recurrence. Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM. For personal use only. Not approved for distribution.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-24 Patients whose disease remains unresectable should be retreated with denosumab, serial embolization, and/or RT. Denosumab may be continued until disease progression, in responding disease. Metastatic Disease For patients presenting with resectable metastases, the guidelines recommend that primary tumor be managed as described above for localized disease.300,301,371,372 Intralesional excision may also be used for resectable metastatic sites. Denosumab, observation, and RT are options for patients with unresectable metastases. Surveillance Surveillance should include a physical exam, imaging (ie, x-ray, CT ± MRI [both with contrast]) of the surgical site as clinically indicated, and chest imaging. As the average time to metastasis ranges from approximately 2 to 4 years,371,372 chest imaging should be performed every 6 to 12 months for 4 years, then annually thereafter, as clinically indicated. Recurrent disease (local or metastatic) should be managed as per primary treatment for localized disease or metastatic disease at presentation. For patients with local recurrence and resectable disease, chest imaging and denosumab can be considered prior to surgery. However, the risk of local recurrence is increased when denosumab is used prior to curettage. Denosumab may be beneficial to define peripheral tumor extent when planning wide resection. Osteosarcoma Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and young adults. The median age for all patients with osteosarcoma is 20 years. In adults >65 years, osteosarcoma develops as a secondary malignancy related to Paget disease of the bone.16 Osteosarcoma is broadly classified into three histologic subtypes (intramedullary, surface, and extraskeletal).373 High-grade intramedullary osteosarcoma is the classic or conventional form comprising nearly 80% of osteosarcomas.373 It is a spindle cell tumor that produces osteoid or immature bone. The most frequent sites are the metaphyseal areas of the distal femur or proximal tibia, which are the sites of maximum growth. Low-grade intramedullary osteosarcoma comprises less than 2% of all osteosarcomas and the most common sites are similar to that of conventional osteosarcoma.374 Parosteal and periosteal osteosarcomas are juxtacortical or surface variants. Parosteal osteosarcomas are low-grade lesions accounting for up to 5% of all osteosarcomas.374 The most common site is the posterior distal femur. This variant tends to metastasize later than the conventional form. Transformation of low-grade parosteal osteosarcoma into high-grade sarcoma has been documented in 24% to 43% of cases.375,376 Periosteal osteosarcomas are intermediate-grade lesions most often involving the femur followed by the tibia.374 High-grade surface osteosarcomas are very rare accounting for 10% of all juxtacortical osteosarcomas.377,378 Pain and swelling are the most frequent early symptoms. Pain is often intermittent in the beginning and a thorough workup sometimes is delayed because symptoms may be confused with growing pains. Osteosarcoma spreads hematogenously, with the lung being the most common metastatic site. For treating extraskeletal osteosarcomas, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-25 Prognostic Factors Tumor site and size, patient age, presence and location of metastases, histologic response to chemotherapy, and type of surgery and surgical margins are significant prognostic factors for patients with osteosarcoma of the extremities and trunk.379-387 In an analysis of 1702 patients with osteosarcoma of the trunk or extremities treated in the COSS group protocols, patient age at diagnosis, tumor site, and primary metastases were identified as predictors of survival.381 In patients with extremity osteosarcomas, in addition to these variables, size and location within the limb at the time of diagnosis also had significant influence on outcome.381 All factors except age were significant in multivariate testing, with surgical remission and histologic response to chemotherapy emerging as the key prognostic factors. In a meta-analysis of data from prospective neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials in 4838 patients with osteosarcoma, female sex was associated with increased chemotherapy-induced tumor necrosis and greater OS, and children had better outcomes than adolescents and adults.388 In a report of the combined analysis of three European Osteosarcoma Intergroup randomized controlled trials, Whelan and colleagues reported that good histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy, distal location (other than proximal humerus/femur), and female gender were associated with improved survival.384 However, high body mass index (BMI) in patients with osteosarcoma was associated with lower OS compared with patients with normal BMI.389 In patients with proven primary metastatic osteosarcoma, the number of metastases at diagnosis and the completeness of surgical resection of all clinically detected tumor sites are of independent prognostic value.24 Patients with one or a few resectable pulmonary metastases have a survival rate that approaches that of patients with no metastatic disease.390,391 Elevated serum ALP and LDH levels have also been identified as prognostic indicators in patients with osteosarcoma.380,382,383,392,393 In a cohort of 1421 patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity, Bacci and colleagues reported significantly higher serum LDH levels in patients with metastatic disease at presentation than in patients with localized disease (36.6% vs. 18.8%; P < .0001).382 The 5-year DFS correlated with serum LDH levels (39.5% for patients with high LDH levels and 60% for those with normal values). In another retrospective analysis of 789 patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity, it was reported that serum ALP level was a significant prognostic factor of EFS in patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity; the 5-year EFS rate was 24% for patients with a serum ALP value of more than four times higher than the normal value and 46% for patients with high values below this limit (P < .001).383 However, in multivariate analysis, these markers did not retain their prognostic significance when compared to tumor volume, age, and histologic response to chemotherapy.380,382 Workup Osteosarcomas present both a local problem and a concern for distant metastasis. Initial workup should include imaging of the primary site (MRI with or without CT), chest imaging including chest CT, and head-to-toe PET/CT and/or bone scan. More detailed imaging (CT or MRI) of abnormalities identified on primary imaging is required for suspected metastatic disease. Plain radiographs of osteosarcomas show cortical destruction and irregular reactive bone formation. Bone scan, while uniformly abnormal at the lesion, may be useful to identify additional synchronous lesions. MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and may be essential for operative planning. MRI is the best imaging modality to define the extent of the lesion within the bone as well as within the soft tissues, to detect “skip” metastases and to evaluate anatomic relationships with the surrounding Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

In addition, ALP and LDH are frequently elevated in patients with osteosarcoma. Serum LDH was significantly higher in patients with metastatic disease at presentation than in patients with localized disease.382 Given that osteosarcoma is most common among children and AYAs, the effect of cancer and its treatment on fertility must be discussed with patients. Fertility preservation methods and alternatives should be discussed with patients as appropriate. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends that conversations concerning fertility be undertaken by an interdisciplinary medical team comprised of oncologists, reproductive endocrinologists and urologists, and reproductive surgeons trained in fertility preservation methods and that fertility preservation programs be affiliated with an experienced assisted reproductive technology (ART) program.394,395 For further details and recommendations, refer to the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology. Finally, a number of genetic aberrations may underly osteosarcoma.396 For instance, it is reported that nearly 70% of patients with osteosarcoma may exhibit mutations in the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma gene, Rb.396 Genetic cancer syndromes that exhibit a predisposition for osteosarcoma include: Li-Fraumeni syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome type 2, Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, RAPADILINO syndrome, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Thus, the NCCN Panel recommends that genetic consultation and testing be considered for patients diagnosed with chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma who possess a family or personal history of bone sarcomas.11 Treatment Surgery Surgery (limb-sparing surgery or amputation) remains an essential part of comprehensive care of patients with osteosarcoma.397 Studies that have compared limb-sparing surgery and amputation in patients with high-grade, non-metastatic osteosarcoma have not shown any significant difference in survival and local recurrence rates between these procedures.398-400 However, limb-sparing surgery is associated with better functional outcomes.401 In patients with high-grade osteosarcomas with good histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, limb-sparing surgery is considered the preferred surgical modality if wide surgical margins can be achieved.398,402 Amputation is generally reserved for patients with tumors in unfavorable anatomical locations not amenable to limb-sparing surgery with adequate surgical margins.397,402 Chemotherapy The addition of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens to surgery has improved outcomes in patients with localized osteosarcoma. Early trials used chemotherapy regimens including at least three or more of the following drugs: doxorubicin, cisplatin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide, dactinomycin, and high-dose methotrexate.403-408 Subsequent clinical trials have demonstrated that short, intensive chemotherapy regimens including cisplatin and doxorubicin with or without high-dose methotrexate and ifosfamide produce excellent long-term results, similar to those achieved with multiagent chemotherapy.409-416 Cisplatin/doxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin (MAP) are included as category 1 recommended regimens for first-line therapy. MAP is preferred in patients <40 years with excellent performance status. In the event a patient receiving high-dose methotrexate experiences delayed elimination due to renal impairment, glucarpidase is strongly recommended.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-27 In a randomized trial conducted by the European Osteosarcoma Group, the combination of doxorubicin and cisplatin was better tolerated compared to a multi-drug regimen with no difference in survival between the groups in patients with operable, non-metastatic osteosarcoma.410 The 3-year and 5-year OS rates were 65% and 55%, respectively, in both groups. The 5-year PFS rate was 44% in both groups. In the INT-0133 study, which compared the 3-drug regimen (cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate) with the 4-drug regimen (cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and ifosfamide) for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic resectable osteosarcoma, there was no difference in the 6-year EFS (63% and 64%, respectively) and OS (74% and 70%, respectively) between the two groups.416 Chemotherapy regimens without doxorubicin or cisplatin have also been evaluated in patients with localized osteosarcoma with the aim of minimizing long-term cardiotoxicity and ototoxicity.417,418 In a randomized multicenter trial (SFOP-OS94), the combination of ifosfamide and etoposide resulted in a higher histologic response rate than the regimen containing high-dose methotrexate and doxorubicin (56% and 39%, respectively). However, the 5-year OS was similar in both arms and there was no significant difference in 5-year EFS rates.418 Good histopathologic response (>90% necrosis) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be predictive of survival regardless of the type of chemotherapy administered after surgery.275,419,420 In an analysis of 881 patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma of the extremities treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery at the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute, Bacci and colleagues showed that the 5-year DFS and OS correlated significantly with histologic response to chemotherapy.421 The 5-year DFS and OS in good and poor responders were 67.9% versus 51.3% (P < .0001) and 78.4% versus 63.7% (P < .0001), respectively. A report from the Children's Oncology Group also confirmed these findings; the 8-year postoperative EFS and OS rates were 81% and 87%, respectively, in good responders.419 The corresponding survival rates were 46% and 52%, respectively, in poor responders. Localized Disease The guidelines recommend wide excision as the primary treatment for patients with low-grade (intramedullary and surface) osteosarcomas and periosteal lesions. If pathologic high-grade disease is discovered after wide excision, adjuvant chemotherapy is a category 1 recommendation. Long-term results (>25 years of follow-up) from patients with high-grade, localized osteosarcoma reveal significant benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy on DFS and OS.420 Chemotherapy prior to wide excision could be considered for patients with periosteal lesions. Although chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) has been used in the treatment of patients with periosteal osteosarcoma, there are no data to support that the addition of chemotherapy to wide excision improves outcome in patients with periosteal osteosarcoma.422,423 In a review of 119 patients with periosteal sarcoma published by the European Musculo-Skeletal Oncology Society, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not a prognostic factor, although it was used in the majority of the patients.423 Cesari and colleagues also reported similar findings; the 10-year OS rate was 86% and 83%, respectively, for patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy with surgery and for those who underwent surgery alone (P = .73).422 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to wide excision is preferred for those with high-grade osteosarcoma (category 1).390,409-411,414-418,424 Repeat imaging using pretreatment imaging modalities should be used to reassess the tumor for resectability.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-28 Following wide excision, patients whose disease has a good histologic response (amount of viable tumor is <10% of the tumor area) should continue to receive several more cycles of the same chemotherapy. Surgical re-resection with or without RT can be considered for positive surgical margins. In a study of 119 patients with osteosarcoma of the head and neck, combined modality treatment with surgery and RT (vs. surgery alone) improved local control and OS for patients with positive or uncertain surgical margins.425 Combined photon/proton or proton beam RT has been shown to be effective for local control in some patients with unresectable or incompletely resected osteosarcoma.426,427 Patients whose disease has a poor response (viable tumor is ≥10% of the tumor area) could be considered for chemotherapy with a different regimen (category 3). However, attempts to improve the outcome of poor responders by modifying the adjuvant chemotherapy remain unsuccessful.428-432 Upon review of the evidence for the 2018 update, this recommendation was changed from category 2B to category 3. Recent data from the European and American Osteosarcoma Study (EURAMOS) Group trial429,433 informing this panel decision are discussed below. A randomized phase III trial of the EURAMOS Group evaluated treatment strategies for resectable osteosarcoma based on histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy. RT or adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended if the sarcoma remains unresectable following preoperative chemotherapy. The EURAMOS-1 trial included cohorts that received maintenance therapy with MAP (methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin); MAP with IFN-α-2b therapy; or MAP with ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE). The addition of maintenance IFN-α-2b therapy to MAP in the adjuvant setting did not improve outcomes for “good responders” to preoperative chemotherapy.433 However, the authors note that a significant portion of patients in the IFN arm did not receive the intended dose of IFN-α-2b due to failure to initiate therapy or premature termination of therapy. Additionally, adding ifosfamide and etoposide to MAP (ie, MAPIE) failed to improve outcomes for “poor responders” to preoperative chemotherapy.429 Chemotherapy should include appropriate growth factor support. See the NCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors for growth factor support. See Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents in the algorithm for a list of specific chemotherapy regimens. Metastatic Disease at Presentation Approximately 10% to 20% of patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis.24,434 The number of metastases at diagnosis and complete surgical resection of all clinically detected tumor sites are of independent prognostic value in patients with primary metastatic disease at presentation.24 Unilateral metastases and lower number of lung nodules were associated with improved outcomes with chemotherapy in patients with synchronous lung metastases.390,391 The 2-year DFS rate was significantly higher for patients with only one or two metastatic lesions than for patients with three or more lesions (78% and 28%, respectively).390 Although chemotherapy is associated with improved outcomes in patients with non-metastatic, high-grade, localized osteosarcoma, the results were significantly poorer in patients with metastatic disease at presentation.434- 437 In a study of 57 patients with metastatic disease at presentation treated with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and a high dose of methotrexate and ifosfamide, the 2-year EFS and OS rates were 21% and 55%, respectively, compared to 75% and 94% in patients with non-metastatic disease at presentation, treated with the same chemotherapy protocol.436 High-dose ifosfamide plus etoposide was examined in a phase II/III trial of 43 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic osteosarcoma, revealing an ORR of 59% ± 8%, but considerable toxicity.438 Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-29 Among patients with primary metastases treated in cooperative osteosarcoma trials, long-term survival rates were higher for patients whose metastases were excised following chemotherapy and surgery of the primary tumor compared to those patients whose metastases could not be removed (48% and 5%, respectively).439 The combination of aggressive chemotherapy with simultaneous resection of primary and metastatic lesions has also resulted in improved outcomes in patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity with lung metastases at presentation.440 For patients with resectable metastases (pulmonary, visceral, or skeletal) at presentation, the guidelines recommend preoperative chemotherapy followed by wide excision of the primary tumor. Chemotherapy, metastasectomy, and SRT are included as options for the management of resectable metastatic disease. In the case that pulmonary metastasectomy is not feasible, ablation procedures may be considered. In a study conducted by UCLA, 16 patients (who had received either prior chemotherapy or surgery) with lung metastases from high-grade sarcomas were treated with SBRT.270 In total, 25 lesions were identified and treated with a median SBRT dose of 54 Gy (range 36–54 Gy) in 3 to 4 fractions.270 OS at 4 years was reported to be 78%.270 In another study, 30 patients with sarcoma with pulmonary metastases received SBRT at a median dose of 50 Gy in 4 to 5 fractions.269 Patients had received prior chemotherapy, surgery, or thoracic RT. Local control at 12 and 24 months was reported to be 94% and 86%, respectively, while OS was 76% and 43%.269 These reports suggest that SBRT may prove to be a promising alternative to surgery for oligometastatic disease. Unresectable metastatic disease should be managed with chemotherapy and/or RT followed by reassessment of the primary site for local control. Surveillance Once treatment is completed, surveillance should occur every 3 months for 2 years, then every 4 months for year 3, then every 6 months for years 4 and 5, and annually thereafter, as clinically indicated. Surveillance should include a complete physical, chest imaging, and imaging of the primary site as performed during initial disease workup. Head-to-toe PET/CT and/or bone scan (category 2B) may also be considered. Functional reassessment should be performed at every visit. CBC and other laboratory studies can be performed as clinically indicated. Relapsed or Refractory Disease About 30% of patients with localized disease and 80% of the patients presenting with metastatic disease will relapse. The presence of solitary metastases, time to first relapse, and complete resectability of the disease at first recurrence have been reported to be the most important prognostic indicators for improved survival, whereas patients not amenable to surgery and those with a second or a third recurrence have a poor prognosis.441-446 In patients with primary non-metastatic osteosarcoma, a longer relapse-free interval to pulmonary metastases was significantly associated with better survival.444 The prognostic significance of surgical clearance among patients with second and subsequent recurrences was also confirmed in a report of survival estimates derived from large cohorts of unselected patients treated at the COSS group trials.447 The combination of etoposide with cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide has been evaluated in clinical trials.448-450 In a phase II trial of the French Society of Pediatric Oncology, high-dose ifosfamide and etoposide resulted in a response rate of 48% in patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma.449 In another phase II trial, cyclophosphamide and etoposide resulted in a 19% response rate and 35% rate of stable disease in patients with relapsed high-risk osteosarcoma.448 PFS at 4 months was 42%.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-30 inhibitor, was evaluated among patients with progressive metastatic osteosarcoma (who underwent 1–2 previous lines of chemotherapy and had a performance status of ECOG 0-1).451 It was found that 65% of patients in the regorafenib arm exhibited non-progressive disease at 8 weeks compared to no patients in the placebo arm.451 In view of confirmed disease progression, 10 patients in the placebo arm were permitted to cross over to the regorafenib arm to receive treatment.451 The most commonly noted adverse effects associated with regorafenib included hypertension and hand-foot skin reaction.451 It was concluded that regorafenib displayed antitumor activity in progressive metastatic osteosarcoma, delaying disease progression. Similarly, in another randomized, double-blind phase II study (SARC024), the activity of regorafenib was again evaluated in patients with progressive metastatic osteosarcoma.452 The study met its primary endpoint with a median PFS of 3.6 months in the regorafenib arm versus 1.7 months in the placebo arm (CI, 0.21–0.85; P = .017; hazard ratio [HR], 0.42).452 The NCCN Panel has included regorafenib under second-line therapy for osteosarcoma (relapsed, refractory, or metastatic disease) with a category 1 recommendation. Similar to its activity in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma, cabozantinib, as aforementioned, also exhibited activity in patients with advanced osteosarcoma. In the CABONE trial, the primary endpoint for patients with osteosarcoma included 6-month objective response as well as 6-month non-progression.295 Secondary endpoints included safety, best overall response, 1-year and 2-year PFS and OS, and metabolic response (evaluated by 18F-FDG-PET/CT 28 days after the first dose).295 Similar to that of Ewing sarcoma, the primary endpoints for patients with osteosarcoma were reached as 12% of patients showed an objective response and 33% were progression-free at 6 months.295 Seventeen percent of patients exhibited partial response and 62% of patients showed stable disease as their best overall response.295 Of those with stable disease, 33% of individuals displayed tumor shrinkage.295 Cabozantinib has thus been included in the guideline as a second-line treatment option for patients with relapsed, refractory, or metastatic osteosarcoma. Single-agent gemcitabine and combination regimens such as docetaxel and gemcitabine; cyclophosphamide and topotecan; or ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide have also been effective in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory bone sarcomas.286,296,297,453,454 Samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (Sm- 153-EDTMP) is a beta-particle–emitting, bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical, and has been evaluated in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic osteosarcoma or skeletal metastases.455,456 Andersen and colleagues have reported that Sm-153-EDTMP with peripheral blood progenitor cell support had low non-hematologic toxicity and provided pain palliation for patients with osteosarcoma local recurrences or osteoblastic bone metastases.455 Results of a dose-finding study also demonstrated that Sm-153-EDTMP can be effective in the treatment of patients with high-risk osteosarcoma.456 Targeted inhibition of a variety of molecular pathways such as mTOR, SRC family of kinases, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) are being evaluated in clinical trials to improve outcomes in patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma. In a phase II trial of the Italian Sarcoma Group (n = 30), sorafenib (VEGFR inhibitor) demonstrated activity in patients with relapsed and unresectable high-grade osteosarcoma after failure of standard multimodal therapy.457 The PFS at 4 months (primary endpoint) was 46%. Median PFS and OS were 4 months and 7 months, respectively. The CBR (defined as no progression at 6 months) was 29%. Partial response and stable disease were seen in 8% and 34% of patients, respectively, and were durable for 6 months or more in 17% of patients.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-31 To extend the duration of activity, a study examined sorafenib combined with everolimus for patients with unresectable or relapsed high-grade osteosarcoma (n = 38).458 Data suggested that this regimen is active in the second-line setting, but toxicity required dose reductions and/or treatment interruptions in 66% of patients. Therefore, under second-line options for patients with osteosarcoma, sorafenib in combination with everolimus is categorized under “Other Recommended Regimens” (category 2B recommendation). The safety and efficacy of HDT/HCT in patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or relapsed osteosarcoma have also been evaluated.459,460 In the Italian Sarcoma Group study, treatment with carboplatin and etoposide was followed by stem cell rescue, combined with surgery-induced complete response in chemosensitive disease.460 Transplant-related mortality was 3.1%. The 3-year OS and DFS rates were 20% and 12%, respectively. The efficacy of this approach in patients with high-risk disease is yet to be determined in prospective randomized studies. The optimal treatment strategy for patients with relapsed or refractory disease has yet to be defined. If relapse occurs, the patient should receive second-line chemotherapy and/or surgical resection when feasible, followed by imaging to assess treatment response. See the Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents in the algorithm for a complete list of second-line chemotherapy regimens. Surveillance is recommended for patients with disease that responds to second-line therapy. Patients with disease progression or relapse after second-line therapy could be treated with resection, palliative RT (that may include Sm- 153-EDTMP), or best supportive care. Participation in a clinical trial is strongly encouraged. High-Grade Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma of Bone High-grade UPS of the bone most frequently arises in the appendicular skeleton and is associated with both a high rate of local recurrence and local nodal and distal metastases.461 The addition of chemotherapy to surgery has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with non-metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH).462-464 In the European Osteosarcoma Intergroup study, adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cisplatin resulted in good pathologic response rates and survival (quite comparable with those for osteosarcoma) in patients with non-metastatic MFH.464 Median survival time was 63 months, and the 5-year PFS and OS rates were 56% and 59%, respectively. The guidelines recommend that patients with high-grade UPS of bone should be treated with regimens listed for osteosarcoma (category 2B). Comprehensive Genomic Profiling for Bone Cancer CGP is defined as next-generation–based molecular assays that provide genomic information about tumors and mechanism of disease to facilitate clinical decision-making.465 Due to the availability of new targeted therapies, patients with bone cancer may benefit from CGP. In a single-center chart review study of 102 patients with advanced sarcoma (including 11% with osteosarcoma, 4% with chondrosarcoma, 3% with chordoma, and 3% with Ewing sarcoma), 93% had at least one genomic alteration and 61% had a potentially actionable alteration based on CGP. Out of the 16% of patients who received targeted therapy based on the CGP results, 50% achieved at least stable disease.466 CGP or another fusion panel should be considered for Ewing sarcoma to identify translocations if pathologic workup of targeted PCR, FISH, or cytogenetics is negative.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-32 targeted therapy opportunities for patients with metastatic chondrosarcoma, recurrent chordoma, metastatic Ewing sarcoma, and metastatic osteosarcoma. Immunotherapy for Bone Cancer Immunotherapies harness the immune system to attack and destroy tumors. New cancer therapies are based on what we know about immune regulation and immune system checkpoints. The immune system is hardwired to regulate itself to maintain self-tolerance, ensuring that no unnecessary damage is done to harm the body after responding to a foreign antigen. For example, some immune cells upregulate cell surface molecules, such as the well-characterized cytotoxic T-lymphocyte– associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 pathway (PD-1/PD-L1), which serve as immune checkpoints that regulate the activation and function of T cells. The self-tolerance enabled by these molecules and other mechanisms is also employed by cancer cells to evade recognition by the immune system. Immune checkpoint blockade is used as cancer therapies reverse T-cell tolerance by blocking inhibitory interactions between tumor cells and infiltrating T cells, thus allowing an antitumor immune response.467-469 Identifying patients whose disease will respond to checkpoint blockade has been difficult to assess, partly due to the difficulty in measuring dynamic immune-related molecules.470 Determining tumor mutational burden has helped predict responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitors.471,472 A high tumor mutation load was also associated with genetic alterations, such as microsatellite instability (MSI), that may lead to dysregulation in DNA repair mechanisms.473 A study analyzing genomes in over 100 tumor types found that a mutational hotspot in the promoter of a DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene is associated with high tumor mutational load.471 Cases of high mutation load have been identified in most cancer types and may identify patients who could benefit from immunotherapy. A study pioneered in patients with advanced colorectal cancer with genomic instability and high tumor mutational burden found responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy correlated to MMR deficiency (dMMR).474 A prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in 86 patients with 12 different advanced cancers with dMMR, including osteosarcoma, found that treatment with pembrolizumab resulted in durable responses (ORR in 53% of patients, with 21% complete response). While median PFS and OS were not reached, estimates of these outcomes at 1- and 2-year survival are 64% and 53% for PFS and 76% and 64% for OS.475 The FDA later granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab, a PD-1–blocking antibody used as a systemic treatment option for adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-high (MSI-H) or dMMR solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.476 A multicohort, single-arm, open-label phase II study (KEYNOTE-158) evaluated the activity of pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors.477 Patients were evaluated for tissue tumor mutational burden (tTMB) status by NGS and those with TMB-high (TMB- H) status (defined as ≥10 mutations/megabase) exhibited clinical improvement with an ORR of 29% compared to 6% among the non– tTMB-H group.477 The FDA has since approved pembrolizumab as a treatment option for patients with advanced solid tumors that are TMB-high and possess no alternative treatment options.478 To inform use of pembrolizumab, testing for TMB and MMR/MSI as determined by a validated and/or FDA-approved assay should be considered.479 NCCN recommends this treatment only for patients with MSI-H/dMMR or tTMB-H chondrosarcomas, chordomas, Ewing sarcomas, and osteosarcomas. NCCN does not recommend this systemic treatment for GCTB since it is not technically a malignant tumor. Printed by Jebasingh J on 11/24/2024 10:56:11 AM. For personal use only.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-33 Recently, another immunotherapy option has become available. PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in combination with CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab was evaluated as a treatment option for patients with advanced or metastatic solid TMB-H tumors in CheckMate 848, a randomized, open-label phase II study. The ORR rate with nivolumab/ipilimumab was 35.3% for those with tTMB-H in an interim analysis, and 22.5% in those with high blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB-H) in a final analysis.480 Based on these data, nivolumab/ipilimumab was added as an immunotherapy option in the guidelines for TMB-H (≥10 mutations/megabase) tumors in patients with unresectable or metastatic tumors (excluding GCTB) who have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Summary Primary bone cancers are extremely rare neoplasms. Chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, chordoma, and Ewing sarcoma are among the most common forms of primary bone cancers, while high-grade UPS and GCTB are relatively rare. Chondrosarcoma is usually found in middle-aged and older adults. Wide excision is the preferred treatment for resectable low- and high-grade chondrosarcomas. Intralesional excision with or without surgical adjuvant is an alternative option for less radiographically aggressive, non-pelvic, low-grade chondrosarcomas. Proton and/or photon beam RT may be useful for patients with chondrosarcomas of the skull base and axial skeleton with tumors in unfavorable location not amenable to resection. Chemotherapy has little role in the comprehensive care of patients with chondrosarcoma. Chordomas arise from the embryonic remnants of the notochord and are more common in older adults. For patients with resectable conventional or chondroid chordomas, wide excision with or without RT is the primary treatment option for chordomas of the sacrum and mobile spine, whereas intralesional excision with or without RT is the treatment of choice for skull base tumors. Adjuvant RT can be considered for large extra-compartmental tumors or for positive surgical margins following resection. RT is the primary treatment option for patients with unresectable chordomas, irrespective of the location of the tumor. Systemic therapy (alone or in combination with surgery or RT) is recommended for patients with recurrent tumors. Poorly differentiated or dedifferentiated chordomas are usually managed as described in the NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma develops mainly in children and young adults. EWS::FLI1 fusion gene resulting from t(11;22) chromosomal translocation is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in the majority of patients. Multiagent chemotherapy is the primary treatment and patients with disease that responds to primary treatment are treated with local control therapy (wide excision, definitive RT with chemotherapy, or amputation in selected cases) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy following wide excision or amputation is recommended for all patients regardless of surgical margins. Chemotherapy (alone or in combination with RT or surgery) is recommended for those who experience relapse following adjuvant treatment. Progressive disease is best managed with RT with or without surgery followed by chemotherapy or best supportive care. GCTB is the most common benign bone tumor predominant in young adults. Intralesional excision with an effective adjuvant is an adequate primary treatment for resectable tumors. Denosumab, serial embolizations, and RT are included as primary treatment options for patients with lesions that are resectable with acceptable morbidity or unresectable axial lesions.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-34 Osteosarcoma occurs mainly in children and young adults. Wide excision is the primary treatment for patients with low-grade osteosarcomas, whereas neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by wide excision is the preferred option for patients with high-grade osteosarcoma. Chemotherapy prior to wide excision can be considered for patients with periosteal lesions. Following wide excision, adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients with low-grade or periosteal sarcomas with pathologic findings of high-grade disease and those with high-grade sarcoma. RT or chemotherapy are recommended if the sarcoma remains unresectable after preoperative chemotherapy. Patients with relapsed or refractory disease should be treated with second-line therapy. Progressive disease is managed with surgery, palliative RT, or best supportive care. Preoperative chemotherapy followed by wide excision of the primary and metastatic tumors is recommended for patients with resectable metastases.
