Factors to consider for duration of anti-osteoporosis therapy include bone mineral density, response to therapy, and risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture. There are case reports of spontaneous fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Patients treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D. An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for denosumab. p The standard dose of tamoxifen is 20 mgday for 5 years. Low-dose tamoxifen (5 mgday or 10 mgevery other day, for 3 years) is an option in patients who are symptomatic or unwilling to take standard 20-mg dosing."

ER testing should be used to determine if a patient is a candidate for endocrine therapies. Cancers with 1%100% of cells positive for ER expression are considered ER-positive. Patients with these results are considered eligible for endocrine therapies (applies to DCIS and invasive cancers). Invasive cancers with between 1%10% ER positivity are considered ER-lowpositive. There are more limited data on the benefit of endocrine therapies in this group, but they suggest possible benefit from endocrine treatment, so patients are considered eligible for this treatment (as above). However, this group is noted to be heterogeneous and the biologic behavior of ER-lowpositive cancers may be more similar to ER-negative cancers. This should be considered in decision- making for other adjuvant therapy and overall treatment pathway. Cancers with 1% staining are considered ER-negative. Patients with cancers with these results have not been shown to benefit from endocrine therapies."

Laboratories should have standard operating procedures to maximize accuracy and reproducibility of results for cases with 10% ER staining or weak intensity staining (to avoid false negatives). The status of controls should be reported for cases with these results.  PR testing by IHC on invasive cancers can aid in the prognostic classification of cancers and serve as a control for possible false- negative ER results. Patients with ER-negative, PR-positive cancers may be considered for endocrine therapies, but the data on this group are noted to be limited.

Patients who may desire future pregnancies should be referred to fertility specialists before chemotherapy andor endocrine therapy to discuss the options based on patient specifics, disease stage, and biology (which determine the urgency, type, and sequence of treatment). Timing and duration allowed for fertility preservation, options inclusive of oocyte and embryo cryopreservation as well as evolving technologies, and the probability of successful pregnancies subsequent to completion of breast cancer therapy are also to be discussed.  Although amenorrhea frequently occurs during or after chemotherapy, it appears that the majority of patients 35 years resume menses within 2 years of finishing adjuvant chemotherapy.  Menses and fertility are not necessarily linked. Absence of regular menses, particularly if the patient is taking tamoxifen, does not necessarily imply infertility."

Menses and fertility are not necessarily linked. Absence of regular menses, particularly if the patient is taking tamoxifen, does not necessarily imply infertility. There are limited data regarding continued fertility after chemotherapy.  Patients should be advised not to become pregnant while on any systemic therapy and specific drug package inserts should be consulted for recommendations.  A prospective trial evaluated premenopausal women who had completed between 1830 months of endocrine therapy before temporarily interrupting endocrine therapy for up to 2 years to allow for pregnancy. At short-term follow-up, the risk of recurrence was not increased among those women who enrolled or those who became pregnant. This approach is an option for women who desire pregnancy, although long-term safety is still unknown.  Although data are limited, hormone-based birth control is discouraged regardless of the HR status of the patients cancer.  Alternative methods of birth control include intrauterine devices (IUDs), barrier methods, or, for patients with no intent of future pregnancies, tubal ligation or vasectomy for the partner.  Randomized trials have shown that ovarian suppression with GnRH agonist therapy administered during adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal patients with breast tumors (regardless of HR status) may preserve ovarian function and diminish the likelihood of chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea.  Smaller historical experiences in patients with ER-positive disease have reported conflicting results with regard to the protective effect of GnRH agonist therapy on fertility.  Breastfeeding following breast-conservation cancer treatment is not contraindicated. However, the quantity and quality of breast milk produced by the conserved breast may not be sufficient or may be lacking some of the nutrients needed. Breastfeeding is not recommended during active treatment with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy or within 6 months of completing trastuzumab or pertuzumab.

These patients generally require further surgeryeither a re-excision to achieve a negative margin or a mastectomy. If re-excision is technically feasible to allow for BCS to achieve no ink on tumor, this can be done with resection of the involved margin guided by the orientation of the initial resection specimen or re- excision of the entire original excision cavity. There may be select patients with stage III invasive cancers who may be eligible for BCS. For these patients, the margins status would be accessed with similar definitions. DCIS  For patients with pure DCIS treated by BCS and WBRT, a quantitative description of any tumor close to margin resection width of at least 2 mm is associated with a reduced risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) relative to narrower negative margin widths, while the routine practice of obtaining margins greater than 2 mm to further improve outcomes is not supported by the evidence. When there is only minimal or focal DCIS involvement near the margin, clinical judgment should be utilized to weigh the risks of re-excision with risk of recurrence for an individual patient.  For patients with DCIS treated with excision alone (no WBRT), regardless of margin width, there is a substantially higher rate of IBTR than treatment with excision and WBRT, even in predefined, patients who are low risk. Although the optimal margin width for treatment with excision alone is unknown, it should be at least 2 mm, with some evidence suggesting improved IBTR rates with margin widths wider than 2 mm.  DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-M), defined as an invasive focus 1 mm in size, should refer to the DCIS margin definition when considering the optimal margin width (2 mm), given that the majority of DCIS-M is comprised of DCIS and systemic therapy utilization for this lesion more closely reflects the treatment pattern for DCIS than for invasive carcinoma.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Invasive Breast Cancer NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion BINV-H 5 OF 7 General Principles of Breast Reconstruction  Breast reconstruction may be an option for any patient receiving surgical treatment for breast cancer. All patients undergoing breast cancer treatment should be educated about breast reconstructive options as adapted to their individual clinical situation. However, breast reconstruction should not interfere with the appropriate surgical, medical, and radiation management of the cancer or the scope of appropriate surgical treatment for this disease. Coordinating consultation and surgical treatment with a reconstructive surgeon should be executed within a reasonable time frame. The process of breast reconstruction should not govern the timing or the scope of appropriate surgical treatment for this disease. The availability of or the practicality of breast reconstruction should not result in the delay or refusal of appropriate surgical, medical, and radiation intervention.  Some patients may choose not to have reconstruction after mastectomy. The option to undergo mastectomy alone with a surgically optimized closure should be offered to all patients as part of a comprehensive discussion of reconstructive options. Achieving the optimal result in this scenario may require additional procedures beyond the initial mastectomy. See BINV-H (6) for patient factors influencing choice of reconstruction.  Selection of reconstruction option is based on an assessment of cancer treatment, body habits of patients, obesity, smoking history, comorbidities, and patient concerns. Smoking and obesity (WHO Class 2 and 3) increase the risk of perioperative complications for all types of breast reconstruction."

Selection of reconstruction option is based on an assessment of cancer treatment, body habits of patients, obesity, smoking history, comorbidities, and patient concerns. Smoking and obesity (WHO Class 2 and 3) increase the risk of perioperative complications for all types of breast reconstruction. Patients with these high risk factors should be counseled about their increased risk for complications following breast reconstruction, including donor site complicationshernias and bulges of the abdominal wall, delayed healing, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, total flap failure (obesity), and implant failure (smoking).  Nipple areolar reconstruction should be offered to patients if the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) has been removed as part of their cancer treatment. Three-dimensional (3-D) tattooing can be offered to patients as an option for NAC reconstruction.  Additionally, patients who are not satisfied with the cosmetic outcome following completion of breast cancer treatment should be offered reconstructive surgery consultation.  Patients known to harbor genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer may opt to undergo bilateral prophylactic mastectomies with reconstruction. Reconstruction can be performed with prosthetic, autologous tissue, or a combination of implant with autologous tissue.  Skin-sparing mastectomy should be performed by an experienced breast surgery team that works in a coordinated, multidisciplinary fashion to guide proper patient selection for skin-sparing mastectomy, determine optimal sequencing of the reconstructive procedure(s) in relation to adjuvant therapies, and perform a resection that achieves appropriate surgical margins.  Revisional surgery may be necessary after breast reconstruction. This may include procedures such as fat grafting, mastopexy, direct excisionsuction-assisted lipectomy, contralateral procedures (in cases of unilateral reconstruction), and others. Patients should be informed before reconstruction that revision surgery may be necessary.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Invasive Breast Cancer NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion BINV-H 6 OF 7 Patient Factors Influencing Breast Reconstruction  Breast reconstruction is elective and patients may choose to not have breast reconstruction. Individual patients present preoperatively with a variety of factors that may impact the choice of reconstruction, the risk of complications, donor site morbidity, and aesthetic result. Each of these factors must be taken into account, along with patient desire, to choose the optimal method of reconstruction.  Patient desire The patient may have a strong feeling towards one form of reconstruction after being given the options. Breast reconstruction should be a shared decision.  Medical comorbidities Medical comorbidities may preclude longer reconstructive procedures such as autologous tissue reconstruction in some patients. The selection of the reconstructive method of choice should take into consideration patient comorbidities. Poorly controlled diabetes is a risk factor for postoperative complications in both implant and autologous tissue reconstruction. Patients should be screened for personal or familial thrombophilia. Thrombophilia may result in reconstructive failure of microsurgical reconstruction or thromboembolic events.  Tobacco use Smoking has been associated with increased risk of delayed wound healing, mastectomy flap necrosis, NAC necrosis in the setting of nipple-sparing mastectomy, infection, and failure of implant-based reconstruction. Patients should be encouraged to stop smoking prior to reconstruction. Smoking has not definitively been shown to increase the risk of microvascular thrombosis in free flap breast reconstruction.  Breast sizeshape If patient has significant macromastia or ptosis, consideration can be given to a reduction pattern mastectomy with either implant-based or autologous tissue reconstruction, or oncoplastic reduction techniques. The volume limitations of implants may preclude an acceptable reconstruction in patients with macromastia if preservation of volume is a priority.  BMI Patients with a markedly elevated BMI may be at increased risk of infectious complications and seromas as well as donor site complications from autologous reconstruction, including delayed healing and hernia formation. Immediate reconstruction can be performed, but delayed reconstruction can be considered if the patient is motivated to lose weight."

Retrospective data support the use of NAC-sparing procedures for early-stage breast cancer, DCIS, risk-reduction procedures, and in some locally advanced invasive cancers (ie, with complete clinical response to preoperative chemotherapy and no nipple involvement with cancer). Contraindications to NAC include: Preoperative clinical or radiographic evidence of nipple involvement, including Paget disease, bloody nipple discharge associated with malignancy, IBC, andor imaging findings suggesting malignant involvement of the nipple or subareolar tissues. Nipple margin assessment is mandatory and should be clearly designated on the specimen.

Patients with small to moderate breast volume with good nipple position are ideal candidates. In patients with large or significantly ptotic breasts, NAC-sparing mastectomies may be offered in select cases by using various reduction patterns or delay techniques to augment the NAC perfusion, either in an immediate or delayed fashion, as long as it does not delay oncologic care. Intraoperative assessment of the NAC perfusion should also guide the decision to preserve the NAC or remove it. Patients should be counseled on the risk of delayed healing, nipple necrosis, loss of pigmentation, loss of sensation, loss of projection, and need for subsequent removal of the NAC. Topical 2% nitroglycerine (45 mg total dose) used prophylactically has been shown to reduce mastectomy skin flap necrosis in both skin- sparing mastectomy and nipple sparing mastectomy in one randomized control trial.  Inflammatory breast cancer Delayed reconstruction after mastectomy for IBC remains the clinical standard, for several reasons.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Invasive Breast Cancer NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion Optimizing Delivery of Individual Therapy  It is important to individualize RT planning and delivery. 3-D CT-based treatment planning should routinely be utilized to delineate target volumes  organs at risk, and assess dose distribution across the entire treatment volume. Radiation to the breastchest wall and nodal regions is generally delivered with single energy or mixed energy photons  electrons. Treatment planning should be optimized to maximally improve homogeneity across the target volume while minimizing dose to organs at risk. Additional techniques such as respiratory control (deep inspiration breath-hold), prone positioning, and cardiac blocks may also be used to try to further reduce dose to heart, lung, and adjacent normal tissue. At a minimum, weekly imaging to verify treatment setup should be utilized. More frequent imaging may be needed for selected cases with inconsistent reproducibility. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) may be utilized with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique to reduce normal tissue exposure of the heart, lung or liver. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) should be used to evaluate, dose and constraints to normal tissues (ie, heart, lung), and planning target volumes (PTVs).  It is common for RT to follow chemotherapy when chemotherapy is indicated. Whole Breast Radiation  Target definition is the breast tissue at risk.  RT dosing: The whole breast should receive a hypofractionated dose of 4042.5 Gy in 1516 fractions; in selected cases 4550.4 Gy in 2528 fractions may be considered. A boost to the tumor bed is recommended in patients at higher risk for recurrence."

On this page, the terms males and females refer to sex assigned at birth.  Few males have been included in breast cancer trials.1 Therefore, recommendations regarding management of breast cancer in males are generally extrapolated from findings of clinical trials focusing on breast cancer in females.  Although there are some biologic and clinical differences between breast cancer in males and females, management of breast cancer in males is similar overall to management of breast cancer in females, with the following special considerations pertinent to male patients2: Genetics: The NCCN Panel recommends consideration of genetic testing for all males with breast cancer (See NCCN Guidelines for GeneticFamilial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic). Breast surgery: Historically, males with breast cancer have undergone mastectomy more often than BCS. However, breast-conservation therapy is increasingly being performed in males and evolving data indicate that breast conservation in males is associated with equivalent outcomes to mastectomy and that it is safe and feasible. Decisions about breast conservation versus mastectomy in males should be made according to similar criteria as for females.2-9 Axillary lymph node surgery: As in females, SLNB should be performed in the setting of male breast cancer with a clinically node-negative axilla.2,4 RT: Indications for radiation after breast surgery in males with breast cancer are the same as for females with breast cancer.2,5,10,11 Use of molecular assays: Data are limited regarding the use of molecular assays to assess prognosis and to predict benefit from chemotherapy in males with breast cancer.2 Available data suggest the 21-gene assay recurrence score provides prognostic information in males with breast cancer.12,13 Preoperativeadjuvant systemic therapy: Chemotherapy withwithout HER2-targeted therapy should be recommended for males with breast cancer according to guidelines for females with breast cancer.2 Options for adjuvant endocrine therapy for males with breast cancer include tamoxifen for 510 years or, if tamoxifen is contraindicated, a GnRH analog plus an aromatase inhibitor."

In males, single- agent adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor has been associated with inferior outcomes compared to tamoxifen alone, likely due to inadequate estradiol suppression, and is not recommended.2,14-17 Follow-up after treatment for early-stage disease: There are only limited data to support screening for breast cancer in males.2 The NCCN Panel recommends that bone density be assessed at baseline and every 2 years in males with breast cancer who receive adjuvant GnRH analog therapy. Low bone density should be managed according to standard guidelines.18 Systemic therapy for advanced disease: Management of advanced breast cancer in males is similar to that in females; however, it is preferred that when an aromatase inhibitor is used, a GnRH analog should be given concurrently.2 Available data suggest single-agent fulvestrant has similar efficacy in males as in females.19 Newer agents such as CDK46 inhibitors in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant, mTOR inhibitors, and PIK3CA inhibitors have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials in males with breast cancer. However, available real-world data suggest comparable efficacy and safety profiles and it is reasonable to recommend these agents to males based on extrapolation of data from studies comprised largely of female participants with advanced breast cancer.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Invasive Breast Cancer NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion General Principles  Hormone receptor-positive (HR) tumors: Breast tumors may be positive for estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR) or both (ERPR). See Principles of Biomarker Testing (BINV-A). ER tumors: ER testing should be used to determine if a patient is a candidate for endocrine therapies.a Patients with cancers with 1%100% ER IHC staining are considered ER and eligible for endocrine therapies, there are limited efficacy data on the subgroup of cancers with ER-low-positive (1%10%) results. The ER-low-positive group is heterogeneous with reported biologic behavior often similar to ER-negative cancers; thus, individualized consideration of risks versus benefits of endocrine therapy and additional adjuvant therapies should be incorporated into decision-making. PR tumors: Patients with ER-negative, PR cancers may be considered for endocrine therapies, but the data on this group are noted to be limited. The same overall interpretation principles apply but PR should be interpreted as either positive (if 1%100% of cells have nuclear staining) or negative (if 1% or 0% of cells have nuclear staining).  Considering that majority of all HR breast cancers are ER or ERPR and ER- negativePR tumors are relatively uncommon, ER andor PR tumors are referred to as HR throughout the guidelines.  The magnitude of risk reduction from adjuvant endocrine therapy is dependent on: Level of ER expression: Low ER expression is less likely to benefit from endocrine therapy. Recurrence score (RS) on gene expression assay test results: Patients with high RS will gain relatively less benefit from adjuvant endocrine alone compared to those with low RS.

Results may be less effective with anthracycline-containing regimens.  Sequence of therapies in the adjuvant setting: Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy should be given sequentially, with endocrine therapy given after chemotherapy. Adjuvant olaparib can be given concurrently with endocrine therapy. For sequencing of RT with systemic therapy, see BINV-I (2).  Considerations for HER2-positive disease: An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab. Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted for trastuzumab. It has different dosage and administration instructions compared to intravenous trastuzumab. Do not substitute trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk for or with ado- trastuzumab emtansine.

Some studies suggest an increased risk of locoregional recurrence following use of preoperative chemotherapy.g These trials delivered chemotherapy regimens that are no longer standard, did not include targeted therapies, did not use modern imaging techniques, andor used non-standard locoregional management. Care should be taken to follow the procedures outlined in BINV-12 and BINV-14 to assure appropriate locoregional management. Accurate clinical staging at baseline prior to initiation of preoperative systemic therapy is critical. See Potentially Operable Disease: Breast and Axillary Evaluation Prior to Preoperative Systemic Therapy (BINV-12).  Tumor response should be routinely assessed by clinical exam and imaging studies (see footnote uu on BINV-13) during delivery of preoperative therapy. If all intended treatment is not completed prior to surgery, the remainder may be given in the adjuvant setting. Patients with operable breast cancer experiencing progression of disease during preoperative systemic therapy may be given an alternate systemic regimen or proceed to surgery if deemed resectable."

Patients with BCI (HI) low demonstrated a lower risk of distant recurrence (compared to BCI HI high) and no significant improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) or OS compared to the control arm in terms of extending endocrine therapy duration.8 BCI (HI) High  For patients with T1 HR-positive, HER2-negative, and pN0 tumors, a BCI (HI) high (5.110) demonstrated significant rates of late distant recurrence.  In secondary analyses of the MA.17, Trans-aTTom, and IDEAL trials, patients with HR-positive, T1T3, pN0 or pN who had a BCI (HI) high demonstrated significant improvements in DFS when adjuvant endocrine therapy was extended, compared to the control arm.8-11 a Gene expression assays provide prognostic and therapy-predictive information that complements T,N,M and biomarker information.

NCCN Guidelines and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Invasive Breast Cancer NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion BINV-O DEFINITION OF MENOPAUSE  Menopause is the permanent cessation of menses and includes a profound and permanent decrease in ovarian estrogen synthesis.  Determination of menopausal status may be required to guide selection of endocrine therapy for breast cancer.  Menopause is usually a clinical diagnosis made after 12 months of amenorrhea. Natural menopause is experienced between ages 4258 years.  Breast cancer treatments may affect ovarian function and menses. In those who are premenopausal at the beginning of chemotherapy and who develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, ovarian function may still be intact despite amenorrhea or may resume over time. The likelihood of ovarian function resuming after chemotherapy is higher among those aged 40 years. Tamoxifen may cause amenorrhea without inducing menopause in premenopausal individuals. Ovarian function suppression induces amenorrhea and reduces ovarian estrogen synthesis without causing permanent menopause.  Twelve months of amenorrhea alone is insufficient to diagnose menopause with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or with tamoxifen  ovarian suppression. FSH and estradiol levels are used to support the diagnosis of menopause; however, clear criteria to guide interpretation of FSH and estradiol in this population is lacking. Tamoxifen may alter FSH levels, limiting its utility in determination of menopausal status. FSH and estradiol should be repeated serially to ensure menopausal status in patients with breast cancer with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea.  Evidence-based criteria for the diagnosis of menopause in patients with breast cancer are lacking. Clinical trials in breast cancer have utilized a variety of definitions of menopause."

An isolated increase in tumor markers should rarely be used to declare progression of disease. Changes in bone lesions are often difficult to assess on plain or cross-sectional radiology or on bone scan. For these reasons, patient symptoms and serum tumor markers may be more helpful in patients with bone-dominant metastatic disease. PRINCIPLES OF MONITORING METASTATIC DISEASE Monitoring of patient symptoms and cancer burden during treatment of metastatic breast cancer is important to determine whether the treatment is providing benefit and that the patient does not have toxicity from an ineffective therapy. Components of Monitoring Monitoring includes periodic assessment of varied combinations of symptoms, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, imaging studies, and blood biomarkers where appropriate. Results of monitoring are classified as responsecontinued response to treatment, stable disease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease. The clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different forms of information to make a determination regarding whether disease is being controlled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable. Clinicians should take into account patient preferences through a shared decision-making process. Definition of Disease Progression Unequivocal evidence of progression of disease by one or more of these factors is required to establish progression of disease, either because of ineffective therapy or acquired resistance of disease to an applied therapy. Progression of disease may be identified through evidence of growth or worsening of disease at previously known sites of disease andor of the occurrence of new sites of metastatic disease.  Findings concerning for progression of disease include: Worsening symptoms such as pain or dyspnea Evidence of worsening or new disease on physical examination Declining performance status Unexplained weight loss Increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or bilirubin Hypercalcemia New radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality New areas of abnormality on functional imaging (eg, bone scan, PETCT) Increasing tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen CEA, CA 15-3, CA 27.29)a Continued Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:19 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Invasive Breast Cancer NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion BINV-R 2 OF 3 Continued PRINCIPLES OF MONITORING METASTATIC DISEASE Use of Objective Criteria for ResponseStabilityProgression  The most accurate assessments of disease activity typically occur when previously abnormal studies are repeated on a serial and regular basis. Generally, the same method of assessment should be used over time (eg, an abnormality found on chest CT should generally be monitored with repeat chest CT).  Some non-clinically important variation in measurement of abnormalities by all serial studies is common and expected. Therefore, the use of objective and widely accepted criteria for response, stability, and progression of disease are encouraged. Such systems include the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et al. New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline version 1.1. Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228-247) and the WHO criteria (Miller AB, Hoogstraten B, Staquet M, Winkler A. Cancer 1981;47:207-214).  Studies of functional imaging, such as radionuclide bone scans and PET imaging, are particularly challenging when used to assess response. In the case of bone scans, responding disease may result in a flare or increased activity on the scan that may be misinterpreted as disease progression, especially on the first follow-up bone scan after initiating a new therapy. PET imaging is challenging because of the absence of a reproducible, validated, and widely accepted set of standards for disease activity assessment.

NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM Staging System For Breast Cancer Primary Tumor (T) The T category of the primary tumor is defined by the same criteria regardless of whether it is based on clinical or pathological criteria, or both. The T category is based primarily on the size of the invasive component of the cancer. The largest contiguous dimension of a tumor focus is used, and small satellite foci of noncontiguous tumor are not added to the size. The cellular fibrous reaction to invasive tumor cells is generally included in the measurement of a tumor prior to treatment; however, the dense fibrosis observed following neoadjuvant treatment is generally not included in the pathological measurement because its extent may overestimate the residual tumor volume. The clinical size of a primary tumor (T) can be measured based on clinical findings (physical examination and imaging modalities, such as mammography, ultrasound, and MR imaging) and pathological findings (gross and microscopic measurements). Clinical tumor size (cT) should be based on the clinical findings that are judged to be most accurate for a particular case, although it may still be somewhat inaccurate because the intent of some breast cancers is not always apparent with current imaging techniques and because tumors are composed of varying proportions of noninvasive and invasive disease, which these techniques are currently unable to distinguish. If the tumor size is slightly less than or greater than a cutoff for a given T classification the size should be rounded to the millimeter reading that is closest to the cutoff. For example, a reported size of 4.9 mm is reported as 5 mm, or a size of 2.04 cm is reported as 2.0 cm (20 mm). The exception to this rounding rule is for a breast tumor sized between 1.0 and 1.4 mm. These sizes are rounded up to 2 mm, because rounding down would result in the cancers being categorized as microinvasive carcinoma (T1mi) defined as a size of 1.0 mm or less."

Obtaining genomic profiles is NOT required for assigning Pathological Prognostic Stage. However genomic profiles may be performed for use in determining appropriate treatment. If the OncotypeDx test is performed in cases with a T1N0M0 or T2N0M0 cancer that is HER2-negative and ER-positive, and the recurrence score is less than 11, the case should be assigned Pathological Prognostic Stage Group IA. 2. If OncotypeDx is not performed, or if it is performed and the OncotypeDx score is not available, or is 11 or greater for patients with T12 N0 M0 HER2 negative, ER-positive cancer, then the Prognostic Stage Group is assigned based on the anatomic and biomarker categories shown above. 3. OncotypeDx is the only multigene panel included to classify Pathologic Prognostic Stage because prospective Level I data supports this use for patients with a score less than 11.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-2 Overview Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in females in the United States and is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death. The American Cancer Society has estimated that 313,510 Americans will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 42,780 will die of disease in the United States in 2024.1,2 The therapeutic options for patients with noninvasive or invasive breast cancer are complex and varied. The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Breast Cancer include guidelines for clinical management of patients with carcinoma in situ, invasive breast cancer, Paget disease, Phyllodes tumor, inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), male breast cancer, and breast cancer during pregnancy. These Guidelines have been developed and are updated continuously by a multidisciplinary panel of representatives from NCCN Member Institutions with breast cancer-focused expertise in the fields of medical oncology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, reconstructive surgery, and patient advocacy. SensitiveInclusive Language Usage NCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation."

SensitiveInclusive Language Usage NCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use language that is person-first; not stigmatizing; anti-racist, anti-classist, anti-misogynist, anti-ageist, anti-ableist, and anti-weight-biased; and inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non-gendered language, instead focusing on organ-specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their future analyses. Guidelines Update Methodology Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update Methodology Prior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature using the following search terms: Breast Cancer, Breast Neoplasms, DCIS, Inflammatory Breast Cancer, OR Phyllodes. The PubMed database was chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature.3 The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key PubMed articles selected by the Panel for review during the Guidelines update meeting as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines and discussed by the Panel have been included in this version of the Discussion section."

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-3 Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (Tis, N0, M0) The diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has increased since the introduction and increased utilization of screening mammography. According to the American Cancer Society, over 50,000 cases of DCIS of the female breast will be diagnosed in the United States in 2022.1 Workup for DCIS The recommended workup and staging of DCIS includes history and physical examination, bilateral diagnostic mammography, pathology review, determination of tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status, and MRI, as indicated. For pathology reporting, the NCCN Panel endorses the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Protocol for both invasive and noninvasive carcinomas of the breast.4 The NCCN Panel recommends testing for ER status in order to determine the benefit of adjuvant endocrine therapy or risk reduction. This is in accordance with the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO)CAP guidelines,5 which recommend that ER testing of newly diagnosed DCIS to determine potential benefit of endocrine therapies for breast cancer risk reduction and progesterone receptor (PR) testing be considered optional. Although the tumor HER2 status is of prognostic significance in invasive cancer, its importance in DCIS has not been established. To date, studies have either found unclear or weak evidence of HER2 status as a prognostic indicator in DCIS,6-9 and no statistically significant benefit to the use of trastuzumab concurrently with radiation in HER2-amplified DCIS.10 The NCCN Panel has concluded that HER2 status for DCIS does not alter the management strategy and therefore is not recommended for DCIS. Genetic counseling is recommended if the patient is considered to be at high risk for hereditary breast cancer as defined by the NCCN Guidelines for GeneticFamilial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic."

    "text": "To date, studies have either found unclear or weak evidence of HER2 status as a prognostic indicator in DCIS,6-9 and no statistically significant benefit to the use of trastuzumab concurrently with radiation in HER2-amplified DCIS.10 The NCCN Panel has concluded that HER2 status for DCIS does not alter the management strategy and therefore is not recommended for DCIS. Genetic counseling is recommended if the patient is considered to be at high risk for hereditary breast cancer as defined by the NCCN Guidelines for GeneticFamilial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic. MRI has been prospectively shown to have a sensitivity of up to 98% for high-grade DCIS.11 In a prospective, observational study of 193 patients with pure DCIS who underwent both mammography and MRI imaging preoperatively; 93 (56%) patients were diagnosed by mammography and 153 (92%) were diagnosed by MRI (P  .0001). Of the 89 patients with high-grade DCIS, 43 (48%) who were not diagnosed by mammography were diagnosed by MRI alone.11 However, other studies suggest that MRI can overestimate the extent of disease.12 Therefore, the surgical decisions for performing a mastectomy for DCIS should not be solely based on MRI findings alone. If MRI findings suggest more extensive disease than is seen on mammography such that a markedly larger resection is required for complete excision, the findings should be verified histologically through MRI-guided biopsy of the more extensive enhancement. Studies performed to determine whether the use of MRI reduces re-excision rates and decreases local recurrence in patients with DCIS show conflicting results. While several studies suggest no reduction in re-excision rates in patients with pure DCIS undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) following MRI compared with those who did not undergo preoperative MRI,13,14 some have demonstrated a reduction in re-excision rate with use of preoperative MRI for DCIS.15,16 One study showed an additional cancer detection rate of 6.2% with preoperative MRI.16 Therefore, the use of preoperative MRI remains controversial. The NCCN Panel recommends only performing breast MRI for DCIS in select circumstances where additional information is warranted during the initial workup, noting that the use of MRI has not been shown to increase likelihood of negative margins or decrease conversion to mastectomy for DCIS.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-4 Primary Treatment for DCIS The goal of primary therapy for DCIS is to prevent progression to invasive breast carcinoma. Management strategies for DCIS treatment include surgery (mastectomy or BCS), andor radiation therapy (RT), followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy in eligible patients to reduce risk of recurrence. The choice of local treatment does not impact overall disease-related survival; therefore, the individuals preferences for risk reduction must be considered. Several prospective randomized trials of pure DCIS have shown that the addition of whole breast RT (WBRT) after BCS decreases the rate of in-breast disease recurrence,17-24 but not distant metastasis-free survival.25 A meta-analysis of four large multicenter randomized trials confirmed the results of the individual trials, demonstrating that the addition of WBRT after BCS for DCIS provides a statistically and clinically significant reduction in ipsilateral breast events (hazard ratio HR, 0.49; 95% confidence interval CI; 0.410.58, P  .00001).26 However, these trials did not show that the addition of RT has an overall survival (OS) benefit. The long-term follow-up of the NSABP B-17 trial showed that at 15 years, RT resulted in a 52% reduction of ipsilateral invasive recurrence compared with excision alone (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.330.69, P  .001).23 The OS and cumulative all-cause mortality rates through 15 years were similar between the two groups (HR for death, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.791.48).23 Similar findings were reported by a large observational study of the SEER database that included 108,196 patients with DCIS.27 In a subgroup analysis at 10 years, of 60,000 patients treated with BCS, with or without WBRT, a 50% reduction in the risk of ipsilateral recurrence (adjusted HR, 0.47 95% CI, 0.420.53; P  .001) was associated with the addition of WBRT."

Results from a retrospective study of 445 patients with pure DCIS treated by excision alone indicated that margin width was the most important independent predictor of local recurrence, although the trend for decreasing local recurrence risk with increasing margin width was most apparent with margins 1 mm compared to 10 mm.48 In a meta-analysis of 4660 patients with DCIS treated with BCS and radiation, a surgical margin of 2 mm was associated with increased rates of IBTR compared with margins of 2 mm, although no significant differences were observed when margins of 2 mm to 5 mm or 5 mm were compared with 2-mm margins.49 A study retrospectively reviewed a database of 2996 patients with DCIS who underwent BCS to investigate the association between margin width and recurrence, controlling all other characteristics.50 Wider margins were significantly associated with a lower rate of recurrence only in patients who did not receive RT (P  .0001), but not in those treated with radiation (P  .95).50 According to the DCIS Consensus Guideline on Margins by SSOASTROASCO, the use of at least a 2-mm margin in DCIS treated with WBRT is associated with low rates of IBTR.47 Additional factors to consider in assessing adequacy of excision for DCIS include presence of residual calcifications, which margin is close (anterior against skin or posterior against muscle vs. medial, superior, inferior, or lateral), and life expectancy of the patient. Notably, in situations where DCIS is admixed with invasive carcinoma, the SSOASTROASCO Consensus Guideline on Margins for invasive breast cancer should be utilized, which supports no tumor on ink as an adequate margin applying to both the invasive and noninvasive components in this mixed tumor scenario.

For DCIS patients undergoing mastectomy, or for local excision in an anatomic location that could compromise the lymphatic drainage pattern to the axilla (eg, tail of the breast), a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure should strongly be considered at the time of definitive surgery to avoid necessitating a full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for evaluation of the axilla.51-54 Since only a small proportion of patients (about 25%) with seemingly pure DCIS on initial biopsy will have invasive breast cancer at the time of the definitive surgical procedure55 and will ultimately require axillary lymph node (ALN) staging, ALND is not recommended unless there is pathologically documented invasive cancer or ALN metastatic disease in patients (by either biopsy or SNLB).

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-7 Trials are ongoing to determine if there might be a selected favorable biology DCIS subgroup where surgical excision is not required. Until such time that definitive evidence regarding the safety of this non-surgical approach is demonstrated, the NCCN Panel continues to recommend surgical excision for all DCIS. According to the NCCN Panel, primary treatment options for patients with DCIS along with their respective categories of consensus are: 1) BCS plus WBRT with or without boost (category 1). While considering RT boost for DCIS, the NCCN Panel recommends an individualized approach based on patient preference and other factors such as longevity. The NCCN Panel notes that WBRT following BCS reduces IBTR rates in DCIS by about 50% to 70%. For DCIS patients treated with BCS alone (without radiation), irrespective of margin width, the risk of IBTR is substantially higher than treatment with excision followed by WBRT (even for predefined low-risk subsets of DCIS patients). 2) Total mastectomy, with or without SLNB with optional reconstruction (category 2A). 3) BCS plus APBI in carefully selected patients (category 2A)."

According to the Panel, select patients with low-risk DCIS may be considered suitable for APBI if they meet all aspects of the definition of RTOG 9804 low-risk DCIS or ASTRO suitable DCIS for APBI. 4) BCS alone (category 2B). The option of BCS alone should be considered only in cases where the patient and the physician view the individual as having a low risk of disease recurrence. For patients with low-risk disease that has been fully resected with negative margins and particularly if they are ER-positive and will be receiving endocrine therapy, the absolute reduction of in-breast recurrence may not be large enough to justify the risks associated with RT. Therefore, according to the NCCN Panel, it may be reasonable to omit RT in such cases. Contraindications to BCT are listed in the algorithm (see Special Considerations to Breast Conservation Therapy Requiring RT). Patients treated with mastectomy are appropriate candidates for breast reconstruction (see Principles of Breast Reconstruction Following Surgery in the algorithm). According to the NCCN Panel, complete resection should be documented by analysis of margins and specimen radiography. Post-excision mammography can be considered for any uncertainty about adequacy of the excision remains (eg, the mass andor microcalcifications are not clearly within the specimen). Clips may be used to delineate the tumor bed and ensure adequate coverage with radiation, provide design of boost and APBI fields, and provide markers should additional surgery be required pending the pathologic margin status review. For patients with pure DCIS treated by BCS and WBRT, a quantitative description of any tumor close to margin is helpful as a resection width of at least 2 mm is associated with a reduced risk of IBTR relative to narrower negative margin widths. The routine practice of obtaining margins 2 mm to further improve outcomes is not supported by the evidence. When there is only minimal or focal DCIS involvement near the margin, clinical judgment should be utilized to weigh the risks of re- excision with risk of recurrence for an individual patient."

For DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-M), defined as an invasive focus 1 mm or smaller in size, the optimal margin width should refer to the DCIS Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:19 AM.

Management of DCIS After Primary Treatment Tamoxifen: DCIS falls between atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and invasive ductal carcinoma within the spectrum of breast proliferative abnormalities. The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial performed by NSABP showed a 75% reduction in the occurrence of invasive breast cancer in patients with ADH treated with tamoxifen.56,57 These data also showed that tamoxifen led to a substantial reduction in the risk of developing invasive breast disease.58 The Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) overview analysis showed that, with 5 years of tamoxifen therapy, patients with ER-positive or receptor-unknown invasive tumors had a 39% reduction in the annual odds of recurrence of invasive breast cancer.59 Similarly, the NSABP B-24 trial found a benefit from tamoxifen for patients with DCIS after treatment with breast conservation surgery and RT. In that study, patients with DCIS who were treated with BCT were randomized to receive placebo or tamoxifen."

In that study, patients with DCIS who were treated with BCT were randomized to receive placebo or tamoxifen. At a median follow-up of 13.6 years, patients who received tamoxifen had a 3.4% absolute reduction in ipsilateral in-breast tumor recurrence risk (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.210.42; P  .001) and a 3.2% absolute reduction in contralateral breast cancers (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.480.95; P  .023).23 The patients receiving tamoxifen had a 10-year cumulative rate of 4.6% for invasive and 5.6% for noninvasive breast cancers in the ipsilateral breast, compared with 7.3% invasive and 7.2% noninvasive recurrences for those treated with placebo. The cumulative 10-year frequency of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer in the contralateral breast was 6.9% and 4.7% in the placebo and tamoxifen groups, respectively.

Anastrozole: In patients with ER-positive andor PR-positive DCIS treated by wide local excision with or without RT, a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (IBIS-II) compared anastrozole (n  1471) with tamoxifen (n  1509). The results demonstrated non-inferiority of anastrozole to tamoxifen.62 After a median follow-up of 7.2 years, 67 recurrences were reported with anastrozole versus 77 for tamoxifen (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.641.23).

The NSABP B-35 study randomly assigned 3104 postmenopausal patients with hormone-positive DCIS treated with lumpectomy and radiation to either tamoxifen or anastrozole for 5 years. Prior to being randomly assigned, patients were stratified by age60 years or 60 years. The primary endpoint was breast cancer-free interval.63 Anastrozole treatment resulted in an overall statistically significant decrease in breast cancer-free interval events compared with tamoxifen (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.560.96; P  .0234)."

The significant difference in breast cancer-free interval between the two treatments was apparent in the study only after 5 years of follow-up. The estimated percentage of patients with a 10-year breast cancer-free interval was 89.1% in the tamoxifen group and 93.1% in the anastrozole group.63 In addition, anastrozole resulted in further improvement in breast cancer-free interval in younger postmenopausal patients (60 years of age). With respect to adverse effects, the overall incidence of thrombosis or embolism was higher in the tamoxifen group while the anastrozole group had slightly more cases of arthralgia and myalgia.63 Results of the IBIS-II and the NSABP-B-35 studies indicate that anastrozole provides at least a comparable benefit as adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive DCIS treated with BCS and RT, with a different toxicity profile. Surveillance after treatment for DCIS helps early recognition of disease recurrences (either DCIS or invasive disease) and evaluation and management of therapy-related complications. The majority of recurrences of DCIS are in-breast recurrences after BCT, and recurrences mostly occur in close proximity to the location of the prior disease. Overall, approximately one-half of the local recurrences after initial treatment for a pure DCIS are invasive in nature, whereas the remainder recur as pure DCIS. NCCN Recommendations for Management of DCIS After Primary Treatment According to the NCCN Panel, in patients with ER-positive DCIS treated with BCT, endocrine therapy with tamoxifen (for premenopausal and postmenopausal patients) or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) (for postmenopausal patients, especially those 60 years of age or in those with concerns of embolism) may be considered as a strategy to reduce the risk of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence (category 1 for those undergoing BCT followed by RT; category 2A for those undergoing excision alone). Low-dose tamoxifen (5 mgday for 3 years) is an option only if the 20-mg standard-dose of tamoxifen is not tolerated (see DCIS-2 in the algorithm). Follow-up of patients with DCIS includes interval history and physical examination every 6 to 12 months for 5 years and then annually, as well as yearly diagnostic mammography."

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-10 Invasive Breast Cancer Workup for Non-metastatic (M0) Invasive Breast Cancer The recommended workup of localized invasive breast cancer (listed on BINV-1 in the algorithm) includes a history and physical examination. Complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests (LFTs) have no added benefit in the detection of underlying metastatic disease in patients with asymptomatic early-stage breast cancers.64 In addition, monitoring of disease relapse with any tumor markers is not recommended. Imaging: Imaging with bilateral diagnostic mammography is recommended; breast ultrasonography is recommended only if necessary. Breast MRI advocates note its high sensitivity for evaluation of extent of disease, particularly for invasive cancer and in dense breasts where mammographically occult disease is more likely to elude preoperative detection. MRI detractors note that MRI has a high percentage of false-positive findings, resulting in further diagnostic workupincluding MRI-guided biopsyin many circumstances.65-67 MRI findings tend to overestimate extent of disease,68 resulting in increased frequency of mastectomies.69-72 MRI findings alone are not sufficient to determine whether BCT is optimal, as additional tissue sampling is needed to verify true malignant disease warranting excision."

MRI use may increase mastectomy rates by identifying areas of mammographically occult disease that may have been adequately treated with radiation after BCS had the disease remained undiscovered without MRI.72 Two prospective randomized studies have examined the utility of preoperative MRI in determining disease extent, and neither demonstrated improvement in rates of re-excision after initial BCS.73,74 Retrospective review of the utility of MRI showed conflicting outcome results one with benefit75 and another without.76 One systematic review67 documented that breast MRI staging altered surgical treatment in 7.8% to 33.3% of patients;67 however, no differences in local recurrence or survival have been demonstrated. In addition, there is no evidence that use of breast MRI increases rates of margin-negative resection.77,78 Breast MRI may assist with identification and management of clinically occult primary tumors presenting with axillary nodal metastases.79 In patients with Paget disease not identifiable on mammography, breast MRI may help determine the extent of disease.80,81 Breast MRI also has utility in screening patients with higher than average risk based on family history.82 If breast MRI imaging is performed, a dedicated breast coil, an imaging team experienced with reading breast MRI and performing MRI-guided biopsy, and multidisciplinary management are the standard of care. According to the NCCN Panel, the use of MRI is optional and is not universally recommended by experts in the field. Breast MRI may be used for staging evaluation to define extent of cancer, in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting, to detect the presence of multifocal or multicentric cancer in the ipsilateral breast, or as screening of the contralateral breast cancer at time of initial diagnosis. Additional indications for breast MRI include: clinical axillary metastasis with an occult primary cancer; Paget disease of the nipple with breast primary not identified by other breast imaging modalities or physical examination; follow-up screening of patients with prior mammographically undetected breast cancers; and those whose lifetime risk of a second primary breast cancer is 20% (based on models largely dependent on family history)."

Pathology Assessment: A central component of the treatment of breast cancer is full knowledge of extent of disease and biologic features. NCCN Guidelines and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-11 knowledge of extent of disease and biologic features is central to the treatment of breast cancer. The specimens should be oriented for the pathologist, and specific requests for determination of biomarkers should be stated (eg, ER, PR, and HER2 status). The Panel also recommends testing for Ki-67 if HR- positive, HER2-negative, and considering adjuvant abemaciclib. Accurate pathology reporting requires communication between the clinician and the pathologist relating to relevant patient history, prior breast biopsies, prior irradiation to the chest, pregnancy status, characteristics of the abnormality biopsied (eg, palpable, mammographically detected microcalcifications), clinical state of lymph nodes, presence of inflammatory change or other skin abnormality, and any prior treatment administered (eg, chemotherapy, RT). The specimens should be oriented for the pathologist, and specific requests for determination of biomarkers should be stated. The use of consistent, unambiguous standards for reporting is strongly encouraged. Data from both national and local surveys show that as many as 50% of pathology reports for breast cancer are missing some elements critical to disease management.12,13 Significant omissions include failure to orient and report surgical margins and failure to report tumor grade consistently. The CAP has developed pathology reporting protocols to promote complete and standardized reporting of malignant specimens. CAP provides a protocol for each disease site that includes cancer case summaries (checklists) along with background documentation. These checklists form the basis for a synoptic, standardized reporting of pathologic findings. Consistent, unambiguous, and complete pathology reporting is a cornerstone of quality breast cancer care."

The NCCN Breast Cancer Panel endorses the use of the CAP protocols for reporting the pathologic analysis of all breast cancer specimens.5 Genetic Counseling: For patients considered to be at high risk for hereditary breast cancer as defined by the NCCN Guidelines for GeneticFamilial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic, genetic counseling is recommended. Distress Assessment: Levels of distress may vary in patients and should be addressed individually. Younger patients have higher rates of psychosocial distress than patients diagnosed at older ages.83-87 The NCCN Breast Cancer Panel recommends assessing for distress in patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer using guidance from NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management. Fertility and Sexual Health: The general considerations for fertility and sexual healthfunction outlined for specific populations in NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology and NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship are applicable to all patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Numerous epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that childbearing after treatment for invasive breast cancer does not increase rates of recurrence or death from breast cancer.88 The offspring of pregnancies after treatment for breast cancer do not have an increased rate of birth defects or other serious childhood illness. However, treatment for breast cancer, especially with cytotoxic agents, may impair fertility and fertility may wane during the 5 to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-12 premenopausal patients should be informed about the potential impact of chemotherapy on fertility and offered the option of fertility preservation if future childbearing is desired. Considerations for fertility preservation should incorporate patient preference, tumor stage and biology, age of the patient, risk of premature ovarian failure based on anticipated type and duration of chemotherapy andor endocrine therapy, as well as the timing and duration allowed for fertility preservation. Several studies report lower rates of fertility discussion among female patients with cancer90-92 despite the updated ASCO guidelines stating that patients should not be excluded from consideration for discussion of fertility preservation for any reason, including parity, prognosis, age, and socioeconomic status.93 The NCCN Panel recommends that all treating physicians should have a discussion with their patients of childbearing potential regarding the options for fertility preservation. Patients who desire to bear children after systemic therapy should be referred to a fertility specialist prior to initiating systemic (chemotherapy or endocrine) therapy.93-99 Randomized trials have demonstrated that GnRH agonists (such as goserelin) administered prior to initiating chemotherapy and then administered concurrently with adjuvant chemotherapy protect against ovarian failure and reduce the risk of early menopause.100-102 In one trial goserelin improved the probability of pregnancy from 11% to 21% in patients with HR-negative early-stage breast cancer.103 Smaller historical experiences in patients with HR-positive disease have conflicting results with respect to the protective effects of GnRH agonists in fertility preservation. Patients should be informed of all the various modalities available to minimize gonadal damage and preserve ovarian function and future fertility. The fertility specialist should discuss specifics of fertility preservation options including hormonal interventions, ovarian stimulation, embryo or oocyte cryopreservation, and other investigational options, as well as the probability of successful gestation and childbirth.104,105 Combining the various modalities for a specific patient may increase the odds of preservation of future fertility."

It is important for fetal safety that patients actively avoid becoming pregnant during breast cancer treatment. Additional Diagnostic Workup The Panel has reiterated that routine systemic imaging is not indicated for patients with early-stage breast cancer in the absence of signssymptoms of metastatic disease. Recommendations for additional metastatic workup should be performed for those patients with signs or symptoms suspicious for metastatic disease, based on lack of evidence to demonstrate any benefits with metastatic workup in early-stage disease.106-108 In one study, metastases were identified by bone scan in 5.1%, 5.6%, and 14% of patients with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively, and no evidence of metastasis was detected by liver ultrasonography or chest radiography in patients with stage I or II disease.106 For patients with stage III breast cancer, the prevalence of a positive liver ultrasound and positive chest x-ray was 6% and 7%, respectively.106 CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function, and alkaline phosphatase tests should be considered only if the patient is a candidate for preoperative or adjuvant systemic therapy. A bone scan or sodium fluoride PETCT is indicated in patients presenting with localized bone pain or elevated alkaline phosphatase. Bone scan or sodium fluoride PETCT may not be needed if FDG-PETCT is performed and clearly indicates bone metastasis, on both the PET and CT component.

The NCCN Panel recommends referring to the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology for special considerations for this population. Margin Assessment: After surgical resection, a careful histologic assessment of resection margins is essential. The NCCN Panel notes that benefit of BCS is predicated on achieving pathologically negative margins after resection. The NCCN Panel accepts the most recent definition outlined in the guidelines established by the SSOASTRO as the standard for negative surgical margins for invasive cancer.134 For patients with stage I or II invasive cancers after BCS, a positive margin is defined as ink on tumor (any invasive cancer or DCIS cells on ink). Patients with positive margins generally require further surgeryeither a re-excision to achieve a negative margin or a mastectomy. If re-excision is technically feasible to achieve no ink on tumor, this can be done with Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:19 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-15 resection of the involved margin guided by the orientation of the initial resection specimen or re-excision of the entire original excision cavity. There may be select patients with stage III invasive cancers who may be eligible for BCS. For these patients, the margin status would be assessed with similar definitions. If margins remain positive after further surgical re-excision(s), then mastectomy may be required for optimal local disease control. In order to adequately assess margins following surgery, the Panel recommends that the surgical specimens be directionally oriented and that the pathologist provide descriptions of the gross and microscopic margin status and the distance, orientation, and type of tumor (invasive cancer or pure DCIS) in relation to the closest margin. Marking the tumor bed with clips facilitates accurate planning of the radiation boost field, where appropriate. For invasive breast cancers that have a component of DCIS, the negative margin definition of no ink on tumor should be utilized based on the SSOASTRO Consensus Guideline on Margins unless it is DCIS-M, which behaves more like pure DCIS and 2-mm margins are recommended. In this setting, no ink on tumor is recommended for either DCIS or invasive cancer cells, primarily because the natural history, treatment, and outcomes of these lesions are more similar to invasive cancer than DCIS."

In this setting, no ink on tumor is recommended for either DCIS or invasive cancer cells, primarily because the natural history, treatment, and outcomes of these lesions are more similar to invasive cancer than DCIS. For specifically challenging cases, clinical judgment and discussion with the patient should precede routine re-excision. The same margin recommendations cannot be applied directly to patients undergoing APBI, where data regarding local recurrence are more limited than WBRT. Individualized clinical judgment should be utilized on a case- by-case basis, using postoperative mammography to identify residual calcifications and clinical-pathologic factors such as quantitative extent of disease near margin, presence of extensive intraductal component (EIC), young age, or multiple close margins to assist in identifying patients who may have an increased risk of ipsilateral recurrence and therefore may benefit from re-excision. Surgical Axillary Staging Axillary status is important for planning systemic adjuvant treatment and RT. The lymphatic pathways from the breast go to the ALNs, internal mammary, infraclavicular, andor supraclavicular lymph nodes. Traditional level I and level II ALNDs require that at least 10 lymph nodes be provided for pathologic evaluation to accurately stage the axilla.135,136 ALND should be extended to include level III nodes only if gross disease is apparent in the level II and I nodes. In the absence of gross disease in level II nodes, lymph node dissection should include tissue inferior to the axillary vein from the latissimus dorsi muscle laterally to the medial border of the pectoralis minor muscle (levels I and II). Historically, ALND has been the standard of care for axillary staging.137 However, ALND is associated with lymphedema and other significant morbidities.138-140 This has been largely replaced with SLNB. SLNs can be assessed for the presence of metastases by both hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (IHC). The clinical significance of a lymph node that is negative by HE staining but positive by cytokeratin IHC is not clear. Because the historical and clinical trial data on which treatment decisions are based have relied on HE staining, the Panel does not recommend routine cytokeratin IHC to define node involvement and believes that current treatment decisions should be made based solely on HE staining."

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-16 a median of 6.3 years.141 In the uncommon situation in which HE staining is equivocal, reliance on the results of cytokeratin IHC is appropriate. The Milan trial (19981999) randomized 516 patients treated with BCS with tumors 2 cm to two arms, one receiving immediate axillary dissection and the other receiving the dissection only if the sentinel node was involved.142 After 79 months of follow-up, there was no difference in OS and DFS.143 Another similar study, NSABP B-32, conducted between 1999 and 2004, randomized 5611 patients with invasive breast cancer 2 cm to either ALND or SLNB alone with ALND performed only if the SLN was positive.144 After 95.6 months of follow-up, OS and DFS were similar in the two groups. Results of a subgroup analysis of this study showed patients with ALND had significantly higher arm morbidity and significantly more restricted work and social activity and impaired QOL.145,146 The ALMANAC trial studied the QOL in patients (n 1031) with SLNB versus ALND.147 After 12 months, lymphedema and sensory loss were higher in the ALND group. Operative time, drainage use, hospitalization, and resumption of normal life were much longer in ALND compared to the SLNB group. The SNAC trial148 and the DBCCG trial149 also showed less morbidity with SLNB compared with ALND. Based on the results of the above studies, it was clarified that for negative sentinel nodes, ALND is not needed. The ACOSOG Z0011 trial addressed the role of ALND in those with a clinically negative axilla but pathologically positive lymph nodes from an SLNB. This trial randomized patients 18 years of age with clinical T1T2 tumors, fewer than 3 positive SLNs, undergoing BCS and WBRT, to SLNB alone (n  436) or to a completion ALND (n  420). In this study, there was no difference in local recurrence, DFS, or OS between patients with positive SLN undergoing a completion ALND versus no ALND."

In this study, there was no difference in local recurrence, DFS, or OS between patients with positive SLN undergoing a completion ALND versus no ALND. Only ER-negative status, age 50 years, and lack of adjuvant systemic therapy were associated with decreased OS.150 At a median follow-up of 6.3 years, locoregional recurrences were noted in 4.1% of patients in the ALND group and 2.8% of patients in the SLNB group (P  .11). Median OS was approximately 92% in each group.151 Long-term follow-up (median 9.25 years) results of the ACOSOG Z0011 study showed no statistically significant difference in local recurrence-free survival (RFS) between trial arms (P  .13).152 The cumulative incidence of ipsilateral axillary recurrences at 10 years was 0.5% (2 patients) in those who underwent ALND and 1.5% (5 patients) in those who underwent SLNB alone (P  .28).152 The 10-year cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrences was 6.2% with ALND and 5.3% with SLNB alone (P  .36).152 The results of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial demonstrate that there is no benefit to ALND in patients with early-stage breast cancer who have only one or two SLN metastases (minimal nodal burden) on SLNB after receiving WBRT as part of BCT.

The results of a trial by the European EORTC group (AMAROS) assessed whether axillary RT provides regional control with fewer side effects compared with ALND.154 This trial included patients (n  4823) with T1 or T2 breast cancer with positive SLNs randomized to an ALND or axillary RT.

The axillary recurrence with axillary RT was 1.8% versus 0.93% with ALND.155 The OTOASAR trial was designed similarly to the AMAROS trial; patients (n  2100) with tumors 3.0 cm who were clinically node negative were randomized to receive either ALND or axillary RT if they had 1 to 2 positive SLNs.156 The results showed no difference in axillary recurrence with ALND compared with SLNB plus RT to the axilla.156 In the setting of preoperative chemotherapy, the question that is being explored is whether ALND may be omitted in patients with complete pathologic response after preoperative therapy. Several prospective studies have evaluated patients with positive lymph nodes before preoperative systemic therapy who had clinical complete response to preoperative therapy and underwent SLNB and ALND. The results of these studies have shown that in those with node-positive disease prior to preoperative systemic therapy, SLNB has a 10% false- negative rate when performed after preoperative systemic therapy. In the ACOSOG-Z1071 trial,158 the false-negative rate was 12.6% and in the SN FNAC trial,159 the false-negative rate was 13.3%. Subgroup analyses from studies have shown that 1) using dual-agent lymphatic mapping (radiotracer and blue dye); 2) identifying three or more SLNs; and 3) marking the metastatic lymph node with a clip before neoadjuvant therapy and then resecting it at the time of surgery reduces false-negative rates to 10%. A subgroup analysis of the ACOSOG Z1071 trial showed lower false- negative rates in patients who had a clip placed in the positive lymph nodes at the time of initial biopsy followed by removal of the clipped node during SLN surgery after preoperative systemic therapy.160 A another study of selective localization and removal of clipped nodes with SLNB, known as targeted axillary dissection (TAD), showed false-negative rates reduced to approximately 2% compared with 4% with removal of the clipped lymph node alone.161 Several ongoing clinical trials are examining further de-escalation of axillary surgery in those who have positive nodes after preoperative systemic treatment."

If any of the above criteria are not met, the Panel recommends level I and II axillary dissection. Based on the AMAROS and OTASAR trial data, no further surgery is recommended only if all of the following criteria are met: the patients have cT12, N0 tumors, have not received preoperative systemic therapy, have 1 to 2 positive SLNs, and will undergo lumpectomy or mastectomy along with adjuvant RT with intentional inclusion of undissected axilla at risk.

According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging, micrometastatic nodal involvement is defined as a metastatic deposit or 0.2 mm but 2.0 mm.162 In patients with clinically suspicious (palpable) lymph nodes or 3 or more suspicious lymph nodes on imaging, or if preoperative systemic therapy is being considered for patients with suspicious lymph nodes at diagnosis on examination or imaging, the Panel recommends pathologic confirmation of malignancy using ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA)163 or core biopsy of suspicious nodes with clip placement. According to the NCCN Panel, the recommendation for ALND of level I and II nodes is limited to patients with biopsy-proven axillary metastases (in those who did not receive preoperative systemic therapy) or who have residual disease after preoperative chemotherapy. Highly selected patients with biopsy-proven axillary metastases, who then converted to clinically node negative after preoperative systemic therapy, may undergo SLNB with removal of the clipped lymph node. This is a currently a category 2B recommendation as the rate of false negatives is high when SLN is performed after preoperative systemic therapy. According to the NCCN Panel, based on available data, the false-negative rate can be reduced by marking biopsied lymph nodes to document their removal, using dual tracer, and by removing 3 or more sentinel nodes (targeted ALND). When sentinel nodes are not successfully identified, the Panel recommends level I and II axillary dissection be performed for axillary staging.

Radiation to the breastchest wall and nodal regions is generally delivered with single-energy or mixed-energy photons with or without electrons. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) should be used to evaluate dose constraints, evaluate dose to normal tissues (ie, heart, lung), and ensure adequate coverage to the intended planning target volumes (PTVs), including the breastchest wall, supraclavicular fossa, axillary levels IIII, and internal mammary nodes. Whole Breast Radiation Therapy WBRT reduces the risk of local recurrence and has shown to have a beneficial effect on survival.114,117 Randomized trials have demonstrated decreased in-breast recurrences with an additional boost dose of radiation (by photons, brachytherapy, or electron beam) to the tumor bed.165,166 For greater homogeneity of target dose and to spare normal tissues using compensators such as tissue wedges, forward planning using segments and IMRT may be used.167,168 Four randomized clinical trials have investigated hypofractionated WBRT schedules (3942.9 Gy in single fractions of 2.63.3 Gy) compared to standard 50 Gy in single fractions of 2 Gy.169-172 The 10-year follow-up data from the START trials173 are consistent with the 10-year results of the Canadian trial,172 which reported that local tumor control and breast cosmesis were similar with a regimen of 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions over 3.2 weeks compared with the standard dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks.172 The START trials reported radiation-related effects to normal breast tissue such as breast shrinkage, telangiectasia, and breast edema as less common with the hypofractionated regimen.173 Another randomized trial showed similar outcomes among patients receiving a hypofractionated schedule (40 Gy in 15 fractions) compared with standard fractionation (50 Gy in 25 fractions) in patients (n  1854) with node-negative breast cancer (n  1608) or DCIS (n  246).174 The 9- year risk of locoregional recurrence was 3.3% in the 50-Gy group and 3.0% in the 40-Gy group."

The NCCN Panel recommends a dose of 40 to 42.5 Gy in 15 to 16 fractions for all patients getting whole breast radiation without regional nodal radiation, based on its equivalence in efficacy and toxicity demonstrated in the moderately hypofractionated trials.173 While these abbreviated courses of RT of 40 to 42.5 Gy in 15 to 16 fractions are the NCCN Panels preferred fractionation schema for whole breast radiation, the conventionally fractionated regimen of 46 to 50 Gy in 23 to 25 fractions may be utilized in selected patients."

The RT boost doses intended to decrease rate of local recurrence are 10 to 16 Gy in 4 to 8 fractions. Ultra-hypofractionated WBRT of 28.5 Gy delivered as 5 (once weekly) fractions may be considered in select patients with pTisT1T2N0 aged 50 years after BCS, though the optimal fractionation for the boost delivery is unknown for this regimen. Alternatively, 26 Gy in 5 daily fractions over one week may be considered, though data beyond 5 years for local relapse or toxicity are not yet available for this regimen and should be discussed with patients prior to its use. The Panel also notes that when using ultra-hypofractionated dosing, it is essential to utilize 3D planning to minimize inhomogeneity and exposure to heart and lung. Chest Wall Radiation The target includes the ipsilateral chest wall, mastectomy scar, and drain sites when indicated. Depending on whether the patient has had breast reconstruction, several techniques using photons andor electrons are appropriate. Chest wall scar boost may be delivered with or without bolus using electrons or photons. NCCN Recommendations for Chest Wall Radiation: The NCCN Panel recommends a dose of 45 to 50.4 Gy in 25 to 28 fractions to the chest wall. A boost at the scar of 1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction to a total dose of approximately 60 to 66 Gy may be considered in some cases based on risk. Special consideration should be given to the use of bolus material to ensure that the skin dose is adequate, particularly in the case of IBC. Regional Nodal Irradiation Two studies, MA.20 and EORTC 2292210925, evaluated the addition of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) to the internal mammary nodes and the upper axillary nodes including the supraclavicular region, in addition to WBRT or chest wall irradiation after BCS or mastectomy, respectively."

NCCN Guidelines and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-21 NCCN Recommendation for RNI: When considering RNI, anatomic variations across patients result in significant differences in prescription depth and field design. The NCCN Panel therefore recommends contouring the individual nodal basins that are at risk using one of the various breast atlases, to ensure adequate RT coverage. 184,185 The recommended dose for RNI is 45 to 50.4 Gy in 25 to 28 fractions to the regional nodal fields. A supplemental RT boost can be delivered to grossly involved or enlarged lymph nodes (ie, internal mammary or clavicular) that have not been surgically addressed.

A supplemental RT boost can be delivered to grossly involved or enlarged lymph nodes (ie, internal mammary or clavicular) that have not been surgically addressed. Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation Several large, randomized trials have been published using various forms of APBI rather than WBRT after BCS. Most of these studies have found that rates of local control in selected patients, with early-stage breast cancer and low risk of recurrence, are equal to those treated with WBRT.44,46,186-188 In the NSABP B-39 trial, 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR with APBI was 4.6% compared with 3.9% with WBRT, yielding an absolute difference of 0.7% with an HR of 1.22 (90% CI, 0.941.58) that did not meet the prespecified criteria for equivalence.43 However, given the small magnitude in IBTR differences between WBRT and APBI, it is not likely to be of clinical significance in appropriately selected patients. QOL, toxicity, and cosmetic outcomes have generally been comparable or slightly favored APBI in randomized trials. For example, the IMPORT-LOW study compared WBRT with partial breast irradiation delivered as 40 Gy in 15 once-daily fractions using reduced-size breast tangents and found less breast firmness, less change in breast appearance, and lower average number of adverse events per person with partial breast irradiation.186,189 The University of Florence compared WBRT with intensity-modulated APBI (30 Gy in 5 fractions, delivered every other day), and 10-year results have shown that APBI produced less acute and late toxicity and better cosmetic outcomes.187 However, the RAPID trial found significantly higher rates of fairpoor cosmetic outcome with 3D conformal APBI delivered as 38.5 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions.44,190 The majority of APBI patients on NSABP B-39 were treated with the same external beam regimen, and treatment-related toxicities were not different for APBI versus WBRT as currently reported.43 Cosmetic outcome analysis, however, is pending."

NCCN Recommendation for APBI: The Panel accepts the updated ASTRO APBI consensus statement for guidance on APBI use.191 The NCCN Panel recommends APBI for any BRCA-negative patient who meets the ASTRO 2016 suitable criteria defined as age 50 years, ER- positive invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 2 cm (pT1 disease) with negative margin widths of 2 mm, and no lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and also permits APBI in patients 50 years of age with screen-detected low- or intermediate-grade DCIS measuring 2.5 cm, resected with 3 mm margins. The Panel prefers the APBI regimen and method followed in the trial by University of Florence (30 Gy5 fractions every other day delivered using IMRT).187 The Panel encourages participation in clinical trials for patients who do not meet the above criteria. Adjuvant Radiation Therapy After BCS Those who have a positive lymph node have a high risk of recurrence. Therefore, after BCS WBRT is strongly recommended with or without boost to tumor bed for node-positive disease (category 1 for those with positive nodes; category 2A for those with negative axillary nodes). This recommendation is supported by the results of a meta-analysis by the EBCTCG showing reduction in 10-year risk of recurrence in those who received WBRT versus those who did not (19% vs. 35%; RR, 0.52; 95% CI 0.480.56).117 In addition, a significant reduction in 15-year risk of breast cancer death (21% vs. 25%; RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.750.90) was also observed.117 Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:19 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-22 For patients with a pathologically confirmed, focally positive margin without EIC, who do not undergo re-excision after BCS, the use of a higher radiation boost dose to the tumor bed may be considered, since generally a boost to the tumor bed is recommended for patients at higher risk of recurrence. Regional Nodal Irradiation After BCS The reduction in the risk of locoregional and distant recurrence and improvement in DFS seen in the MA.20 and EORTC 2292210925 trials,181,182 and the reduction in breast cancer mortality with 15-year follow- up of the EORTC 22922 patients,183 support the importance of RNI after BCS. As mentioned previously, routine inclusion of the internal mammary nodes as a component of RNI remains somewhat controversial due to the associated cardiac and lung toxicities. A Korean trial KROG 08-06 studied independent effect on DFS of RT to internal mammary nodes after BCS or mastectomy for node-positive disease,192 randomizing patients to RNI with internal mammary RT versus RNI without internal mammary RT. Radiation to the internal mammary nodes did not significantly improve the DFS in patients with node-positive breast cancer. However, there was a statistically significant benefit in outcomes with internal mammary nodal RT for patients with medially or centrally located tumors.192 Conflicting data have arisen from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group that recently reported 15-year follow-up of their study on RT to internal mammary nodes in patients (n  3089) with positive nodes and early- stage breast cancer.193 In this study, RT to the internal mammary nodes was delivered to right-sided patients (n  1,491), while no RT to internal mammary nodes was delivered to left-sided patients (n  1,598). The study reported a 15-year improved OS rate of 60.1% with RT to internal mammary nodes compared to 55.4% with no RT to internal mammary nodes. Improvements were also seen with respect to risk of developing distant recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality favoring RT to internal mammary nodes.193 Clinical judgment is needed when determining inclusion of the internal mammary nodes during RNI."

Therefore, the NCCN Panel no longer specifies the fields that should be included for RNI and refers to it as comprehensive RNI. According to the Panel, patient selection should consider risks versus benefits including long-term organ (cardiac and lung) toxicities, comorbidities of the patient, age, and life expectancy. In including RT to the internal mammary nodes, meticulous treatment planning with normal tissue dose constraints is mandatory. RNI After BCS for Node-Negative Disease: The NCCN Panel recommends consideration of comprehensive RNI in patients with centralmedial tumors (in accordance with EORTC 22922 trial criteria) and in accordance with the MA.20 criteria: 3 tumors, as well as those with T2 tumors who have undergone limited axillary dissection (10 lymph nodes) and also have other risk factors, including high-grade histology, ER- negative disease, or LVI.181 RNI After BCS for Node-Positive Disease: For those with 1 to 3 positive nodes, if a patient meets all of the following criteriahas cT1T2, cN0; did not receive preoperative chemotherapy; and has 1 to 2 positive SLNsthe use of comprehensive RNI with or without the intentional inclusion of the axilla is at the discretion of the radiation oncologist. If the patients do not meet all the criteria listed, the NCCN Panel recommends WBRT with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk (category 1) with strong consideration of comprehensive RNI. For those with 4 or more positive nodes, the NCCN Panel recommends comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk (category 1).

Locoregional recurrence rates were 1% in the BCS, radiation, and tamoxifen arm and 4% in the BCS plus tamoxifen arm. There were no differences in OS, DFS, or need for mastectomy.194 These results were confirmed in an updated analysis of this study with a median follow-up of 12.6 years.195 At 10 years, a statistically significant reduction in IBTR was seen with RT with 90% of patients in the BCS and tamoxifen arm compared with 98% in the BCS plus radiation and tamoxifen arm.195 Concordant results have been demonstrated in other studies of similar design.196,197 Whether the increase in local relapse without RT is relevant for an individual patient should be individualized after a discussion of the risks and benefits of RT and patient commitment to 5 years of endocrine therapy if RT omission is being considered. The NCCN Guidelines allow for the use of BCS (pathologically negative margin required) with 5 years of tamoxifen or an AI, without breast irradiation, for patients 70 years with clinically negative lymph nodes and ER-positive, T1 breast cancers (category 1). Adjuvant Radiation Therapy After Mastectomy Post-Mastectomy RT for Node-Positive Disease Randomized clinical trials have shown that a DFS and OS advantage is conferred by the irradiation of chest wall and regional lymph nodes in patients with positive ALNs after mastectomy and ALND.198-202 In these trials, the ipsilateral chest wall and the ipsilateral locoregional lymph nodes were irradiated. The results of EBCTCG meta-analyses show that RT after mastectomy and axillary node dissection reduced both recurrence and breast cancer mortality in the patients with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes even when systemic therapy was administered.182,203 According to the NCCN Panel, post-mastectomy radiation to the chest wall is recommended in all of these patients (category 1). Data from the EORTC 2292210925 trial support the inclusion of RNI in patients undergoing post- mastectomy radiation. The trial assessed the independent effects of including RNI versus no RNI when treating the chest wall after mastectomy.

    "text": "Considerations for RT in Patients Receiving Preoperative Systemic Therapy The Panel recommends that decisions related to administration of adjuvant RT for patients receiving preoperative systemic chemotherapy should be made based on maximal stage (ie, clinicalanatomic stage, tumor characteristics) at diagnosis (before preoperative systemic therapy) and pathologic stage at definitive surgery (after preoperative systemic therapy). Data from numerous studies in patients with stage III disease suggest that postoperative RT improves local control even for patients who have a pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.205-208 RT After Preoperative Therapy and BCS: Those who have clinically negative nodes at diagnosis, that remain pathologically node-negative at definitive surgery (after systemic therapy), should receive adjuvant RT to the whole breast with the addition of boost to the tumor bed after SLNB. Patients who have clinicallyradiographically positive nodes at diagnosis and convert to clinicallyradiographically node-negative after preoperative chemotherapy are candidates for the NSABP B-51 trial assessing the benefit of RNI. Until the results of this trial become available, the existing data suggest that node-positive disease at presentation is at high risk for locoregional recurrence and should be considered to receive comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk. Patients who have clinicallyradiographically positive nodes at diagnosis who convert to clinicallyradiographically negative nodes after preoperative chemotherapy, but are found to have persistent nodal disease on SLNB, are candidates for the ALLIANCE 11202 trial assessing whether ALND can be safely replaced with axillary RT. ALND is the standard arm of this trial; however, in the event that a neoadjuvant therapy patient with node- positive disease (ypN1) does not undergo a complete axillary dissection, all levels of the undissected axilla should be included with the radiation treatment. RT After Preoperative Therapy and Mastectomy: Those who have clinically positive nodes at diagnosis that respond to preoperative systemic therapy and become node-negative should be strongly considered to receive RT to the chest wall and comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk based on the discussion above. For those with positive nodes (ypN1) after preoperative systemic therapy, axillary dissection is the standard treatment arm of the ongoing Alliance 11202 trial; however, if RT is indicated it should include chest wall along with comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk."

NCCN Guidelines and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-25 If chemotherapy and radiation are indicated after surgery, adjuvant radiation is typically delivered after the completion of chemotherapy.209,210 This recommendation is based on results of the Upfront-Outback trial in which patients who had undergone BCS and axillary dissection were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy following RT or RT following chemotherapy. The initial results showed an increased rate of local recurrence in the group with delayed RT at a median follow-up of 58 months;210 however, differences in rates of distant or local recurrence were not statistically significant when the two arms were compared at 135-month follow-up.209 While it is common for RT to follow chemotherapy when chemotherapy is indicated, based on data from prospective and retrospective studies, CMF (cyclophosphamidemethotrexatefluorouracil) and RT may be given concurrently. Data from multiple studies of patients treated with endocrine therapy either before, during, or after RT suggest no difference in outcomes or toxicity.211-214 Therefore, according to the NCCN Panel, sequential or concurrent endocrine therapy with RT is acceptable. However, due to compounding side effects, initiating endocrine therapy at the completion of RT may be preferred. When adjuvant capecitabine215 is indicated, since it is a known radiosensitizing agent with potential to increase toxicity to normal tissue, it should be given after completion of adjuvant RT."

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-26 Breast Reconstruction Breast reconstruction may be an option for anyone receiving surgical treatment for breast cancer. Therefore, all patients undergoing breast cancer treatment should be educated about breast reconstructive options as adapted to their individual clinical situation and be offered an opportunity to consult with a reconstructive plastic surgeon. Breast reconstruction should not interfere with the appropriate surgical management. This may increase the risk of overall and cancer-related death, especially in those with late-stage disease.218 Coordinating consultation and surgical treatment with a reconstructive surgeon should be executed within a reasonable timeframe. Several reconstructive approaches are summarized for these patients in the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer under Principles of Breast Reconstruction Following Surgery. The decision regarding type of reconstruction includes patient preference, body habitus, smoking history, comorbidities, plans for irradiation, and expertise and experience of the reconstruction team. Smoking and obesity increase the risk of complications for all types of breast reconstruction whether with implant or flap.219-223 Smoking and obesity are therefore considered a relative contraindication to breast reconstruction by the NCCN Panel. Patients should be informed of increased rates of wound healing complications and partial or complete flap failure among patients who smoke and have obesity."

Patients should be informed of increased rates of wound healing complications and partial or complete flap failure among patients who smoke and have obesity. Reconstruction is an optional procedure that does not impact the probability of recurrence or death, but it is associated with an improved QOL for many patients. It is sometimes necessary to perform surgery on the contralateral breast (ie, breast reduction, implantation) to achieve optimal symmetry between the ipsilateral reconstructed breast and the contralateral breast. Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy Mastectomy results in loss of the breast for breastfeeding, loss of sensation in the skin of the breast and nipple-areolar complex (NAC), and loss of the breast for cosmetic, body image, and psychosocial purposes. The loss of the breast for cosmetic, body image, and psychosocial issues may be partially overcome through the performance of breast reconstruction with or without reconstruction of the NAC. Those undergoing mastectomy should be offered consultation regarding options and timing of breast reconstruction. Many factors must be considered in the decision-making about breast reconstruction. There are several different types of breast reconstruction that include the use of implants, autogenous tissues, or both.224-226 Reconstruction with implants can be performed either by immediate placement of a permanent subpectoral implant or initial placement of a subpectoral expander implant followed by gradual expansion of the implant envelope with stretching of the pectoralis major muscle and overlying skin followed by replacement of the expander with a permanent implant. A wide variety of implants are available that contain saline, silicone gel, or a combination of saline and silicone gel inside a solid silicone envelope. Autogenous tissue methods of reconstruction use various combinations of fat, muscle, skin, and vasculature from donor sites (ie, abdomen, buttock, back) that may be brought to the chest wall with their original blood supply (pedicle flap) or as free flaps with microvascular anastomoses to supply blood from the chest wallthorax.227 Several procedures using autologous tissue are available including transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap, latissimus dorsi flap, and gluteus maximus myocutaneous flap reconstruction.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-27 Composite reconstruction techniques use implants in combination with autogenous tissue reconstruction to provide volume and symmetry. Patients with underlying diabetes or who smoke tobacco have increased rates of complications following autogenous tissue breast cancer reconstruction, presumably because of underlying microvascular disease. Reconstruction can be performed either at the time of the mastectomy known as immediate breast reconstruction and under the same anesthetic or in a delayed fashion any time, known as delayed breast reconstruction. In many cases, breast reconstruction involves a staged approach requiring more than one procedure such as surgery on the contralateral breast to improve symmetry, revision surgery involving the breast andor donor site, andor nipple and areola reconstruction and tattoo pigmentation. Plans for post-mastectomy RT can impact decisions related to breast reconstruction since there is a significantly increased risk of implant capsular contracture following irradiation of an implant. Furthermore, post- mastectomy irradiation may have a negative impact on breast cosmesis when autologous tissue is used in immediate breast reconstruction, and may interfere with the targeted delivery of radiation when immediate reconstruction is performed using either autologous tissue or breast implants.228,229 Some studies, however, have not found a significant compromise in reconstruction cosmesis after RT.230 The preferred approach to breast reconstruction for irradiated patients was a subject of controversy among the Panel. While some experienced breast cancer teams have employed protocols in which immediate tissue reconstructions are followed by RT, generally RT is preferred to precede autologous reconstruction due to the reported loss in reconstruction cosmesis (category 2B). When implant reconstruction is planned in a post- mastectomy patient requiring RT, the NCCN Panel prefers a staged approach with immediate tissue expander placement followed by implant placement."

When implant reconstruction is planned in a post- mastectomy patient requiring RT, the NCCN Panel prefers a staged approach with immediate tissue expander placement followed by implant placement. Immediate placement of an implant in patients requiring postoperative radiation has an increased rate of capsular contracture, malposition, poor cosmesis, and implant exposure. Surgery to exchange the tissue expanders with permanent implants can be performed prior to radiation or after completion of RT. In a previously radiated patient, the use of tissue expandersimplants is relatively contraindicated.231 Tissue expansion of irradiated skin can result in a significantly increased risk of capsular contracture, malposition, poor cosmesis, implant exposure, and failed reconstruction.232,233 If a patient has previously received RT to the breast, autologous tissue reconstruction is the preferred method of breast reconstruction. Skin-Sparing Mastectomy Skin-sparing mastectomy procedures are appropriate for some patients and involve removal of the breast parenchyma including the NAC while preserving the majority of the original skin envelope, and are followed by immediate reconstruction with autogenous tissue, a prosthetic implant, or a composite of autogenous tissue and an implant. Skin-sparing mastectomy involving preservation of the skin of the NAC has become the subject of increased attention. Possible advantages of this procedure include improvements in breast cosmesis, body image, and nipple sensation following mastectomy, although the impact of this procedure on these QOL issues has not been well-studied.234-236 There are limited data from surgical series, with short follow-up, that suggest that performance of NAC-sparing mastectomy in selected patients is associated with low rates of occult involvement of the NAC with breast cancer and local disease recurrence.235,237,238 NAC-sparing procedures may be an option in patients who are carefully selected by experienced multidisciplinary teams.

Several prospective trials are underway to evaluate NAC-sparing mastectomy in the setting of cancer and enrollment in such trials is encouraged. Advantages of a skin-sparing mastectomy procedure include an improved cosmetic outcome resulting in a reduction in the size of the mastectomy scar and a more natural breast shape, especially when autologous tissue is used in reconstruction,241 and the ability to perform immediate reconstruction.

According to the NCCN Panel, skin-sparing mastectomy should be performed by an experienced breast surgery team that works in a coordinated, multidisciplinary fashion to guide proper patient selection for skin-sparing mastectomy, determine optimal sequencing of the reconstructive procedure(s) in relation to adjuvant therapies, and perform a resection that achieves appropriate surgical margins. Post-mastectomy radiation should still be applied for patients treated by skin-sparing mastectomy following the same selection criteria as for standard mastectomy. Breast Reconstruction After Lumpectomy Issues related to breast reconstruction also pertain to those who undergo or have undergone a lumpectomy, particularly in situations where the surgical defect is large andor expected to be cosmetically unsatisfactory. An evaluation of the likely cosmetic outcome of lumpectomy should be performed prior to surgery. Oncoplastic techniques for breast conservation can extend breast-conserving surgical options in situations where the resection by itself would likely yield an unacceptable cosmetic outcome.247 The evolving field of oncoplastic surgery includes the use of volume displacement techniques performed in conjunction with a large partial mastectomy.248 Oncoplastic volume displacement procedures combine the removal of generous regions of breast tissue (typically designed to conform to the segmentally distributed cancer in the breast) with mastopexy techniques in which remaining breast tissues are shifted together within the breast envelope to fill the resulting surgical defect and thereby avoid the creation of significant breast deformity."

Volume displacement techniques are generally performed during the same operative setting as the breast-conserving lumpectomy by the same surgeon who is performing the cancer resection.248,249 Advantages of oncoplastic volume displacement techniques are that they permit the removal of larger regions of breast tissue, thereby achieving wider surgical margins around the cancer, and at the same time better preserve the natural shape and appearance of the breast than do standard breast resections.250 Limitations of oncoplastic volume displacement techniques include lack of standardization among centers, performance at only a limited number of sites in the United States, and the possible necessity for subsequent mastectomy if pathologic margins are positive when further breast-conserving attempts are deemed impractical or unrealistic.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-30 Systemic Therapies (Preoperative and Adjuvant) Preoperative Systemic Therapy The NCCN Panel has outlined the rationale, appropriate patient selection, and response assessment for preoperative systemic therapy in a new section titled, Principles of Preoperative Chemotherapy. Randomized clinical trials have found no significant differences in long-term outcomes when systemic chemotherapy is given before or after surgery.251,252 Historically, a primary advantage of administering preoperative systemic therapy has been to improve surgical outcomes. Preoperative systemic therapy can convert inoperable tumors to operable and also downstage a significant number of patients with operable breast cancer to allow for more limited breast conservation procedures. 253 Results from large clinical trials and retrospective reviews indicate that breast conservation rates are improved with preoperative systemic therapy.252,254 Clinicians need to carefully consider the extent of disease in the breast, tumor biology and likelihood of adequate tumor response before recommending preoperative systemic therapy to improve the likelihood of successful breast conservation. In addition, use of preoperative systemic therapy may provide important prognostic information based on response to therapy. Achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy is associated with favorable disease-free and OS in early-stage breast cancer. The correlation between pathologic response and long-term outcomes in patients with early-stage breast cancer is strongest for patients with triple-negative breast cancer, less so for HER2-positive disease, and least for hormone-positive disease.255-257 Other benefits of preoperative systemic therapy include allowing time for appropriate genetic testing and for planning potential breast reconstruction in patients proceeding with mastectomy. For those with significant residual disease after standard preoperative systemic therapy, it may provide an opportunity to identify patients who may benefit from further adjuvant therapy after surgery."

It many allow sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone or allow for limited radiation fields if clinically node positive disease becomes clinically node negative after preoperative systemic therapy. In addition, preoperative systemic therapy also serves as an excellent research platform to test novel therapies and predictive biomarkers by providing tumor specimens and blood samples prior to and during systemic treatment. Selection of Patients for Preoperative Therapy Not all patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative systemic therapy. According to the NCCN Panel, among those with inoperable breast tumors, preoperative systemic therapy is indicated in patients with locally advanced or inoperable breast cancer including those with inflammatory breast cancer; those with bulky or matted cN2 axillary nodes; cN3 regional lymph node nodal disease; and cT4 tumors. In patients with operable tumors, preoperative systemic therapy is the preferred approach for the following scenarios: for patients with TNBC and HER2 breast cancer that is clinical stage T2N0 and higher or is clinically node positive; if the patients breast cancer subtype is associated with a high likelihood of response; or if a patient desires BCS and the size of the tumor is large relative to that of the breast. When preoperative systemic therapy is used to improve the likelihood of successful breast conservation, the surgical plan should consider the possibility that clear surgical margins may not always be obtained, and a follow-up mastectomy may be required, with or without breast reconstruction.

The NCCN Panel cautions that preoperative systemic therapy is not appropriate for certain patients. Preoperative systemic therapy should not be offered in patients with extensive in situ disease when the extent of invasive disease cannot be defined; in patients where the extent of the tumor is poorly delineated; or in those whose tumors are not clinically assessable. The decision to utilize preoperative therapy should be made in the context of a coordinated and collaborative multi-disciplinary team. For predicting the response of pre-operative endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative, cN0 breast cancer, data from the TransNEOS study demonstrate a significant correlation between 21 gene assay Recurrence Score and clinical response to preoperative letrozole. Those whose tumors had a Recurrence Score between 0-17 were significantly more likely to respond to preoperative letrozole compared with Recurrence Score of 31-100.258 For predicting the response to pre-operative chemotherapy for post- menopausal, ER-positive, HER2-negative patients with T1T2, node negative tumors, another study evaluated the role of the Recurrence Score with pathologic response rates after pre-operative systemic therapy. Their findings suggest high Recurrence Scores are associated with a higher likelihood of pCR after preoperative chemotherapy.259 Based on the above two studies that showed the use of 21-gene Recurrence Score in predicting response to preoperative chemotherapy, 258,259 the NCCN panel has added a footnote for considering the use of a gene expression assay during workup when contemplating preoperative endocrine or systemic therapy for postmenopausal patients with cN0, operable ER-positive, HER2-negative disease, to aid in predicting response to preoperative therapy.

The preferred endocrine therapy option for postmenopausal patients is an aromatase inhibitor. The panel has added a comment that the optimal response to endocrine therapy, if achieved is anywhere between 4-6 months based on the above trials. HER2-Targeted Therapy: For patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, that are candidates for preoperative systemic therapy, chemotherapy and trastuzumab-based therapy is recommended.269 Chemotherapy and dual anti-HER2 blockade associated with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab has shown significant improvements in the pCR rate when compared with chemotherapy and trastuzumab in the preoperative setting.

Response Assessment During Preoperative Chemotherapy The NCCN panel recommends that tumor response should be routinely assessed by clinical exam during the delivery of preoperative systemic therapy. Patients with operable breast cancer experiencing progression of disease while undergoing preoperative systemic therapy should be taken promptly to surgery. Imaging during preoperative systemic therapy should not be done routinely but may be considered if tumor progression is suspected. In a multicenter analysis of patients (n5161), the residual cancer burden (RCB) after preoperative chemotherapy was seen to be prognostic within each breast cancer subtype.275 Higher RCB scores were significantly associated with worse event-free survival, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.55 to 2.16 across different breast cancer subtypes. This study highlights RCB as a prognostic factor for outcomes in patients with breast cancer patients undergoing preoperative chemotherapy.275 As noted under the workup section, in order to have a standardized method of pathology reporting, the NCCN endorses the CAP protocol for pathology reporting for all invasive and noninvasive carcinomas of the breast."

Adjuvant Systemic Therapy After surgical treatment, adjuvant systemic therapy should be considered. In patients with early-stage breast cancer, systemic adjuvant therapy is administered to reduce risk of cancer recurrence. The decision is often based on individual risk of relapse and predicted sensitivity to a particular treatment (eg, ERPR and HER2 status). The decision to use systemic adjuvant therapy requires considering and balancing risk for disease recurrence with local therapy alone, the magnitude of benefit from applying adjuvant therapy, toxicity of the therapy, and comorbidity. The decision-making process requires collaboration between the health care team and patient. Stratification for Systemic Adjuvant Therapy The NCCN Guidelines stratify, patients with breast cancer based on their HR- status and HER2 expression. Patients are then further stratified based on risk of disease recurrence based on anatomic and pathologic characteristics (ie, tumor grade, tumor size, ALN status, angiolymphatic invasion)."

Adjuvant Systemic therapy for HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors Patients with HR positive, HER2-negative tumors, receive adjuvant endocrine therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence and those deemed at high risk for distant recurrence despite adjuvant endocrine therapy, receive adjuvant chemotherapy. The NCCN Guidelines call for the determination of ER and PR content in all primary invasive breast cancers276 to determine whether a patient is a candidate for endocrine therapies. Patients with cancers with 1%100% ER IHC staining are considered ER and eligible for endocrine therapies. Given the limited efficacy data on the ER-low-positive (1%-10%) group, with ER-low-positive patients reported to be a heterogeneous group with a natural historybiologic behavior often similar to ER-negative cancers, individualized consideration of risks versus benefits of endocrine therapy and additional adjuvant therapies should be incorporated into decision- making. Patients with ER-negative, PR-positive cancers may also be considered for endocrine therapies, however, the efficacy data on this group are also limited. The same overall interpretation principles apply but PR should be interpreted as either positive (if 1%100% of cells have nuclear staining) or negative (if 1% or 0% of cells have nuclear staining). For the purposes of this guideline, any ER andor PR-positive tumors is referred to as hormone receptor (HR)-positive, given that the majority of all breast cancers are ER-positive or ER and PR-positive and the subgroup of ER negativePR-positive tumors are relatively uncommon. The magnitude of risk reduction from adjuvant endocrine therapy is dependent on level of ER-expression and on recurrence score (RS) of gene expression assay test results. Low level of ER expression is less likely to benefit from endocrine therapy and a high RS will gain less benefit with endocrine therapy alone versus those with low RS."

All three have shown similar anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity profiles in randomized studies in the adjuvant settings. Ovarian Function Suppression and Endocrine Therapy: Ovarian function suppression (OFS) is achieved with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation. OFS is generally considered in those who are premenopausal and for tumors with high enough recurrence risk where the additional absolute decrease in recurrence compared with tamoxifen alone is worth the additional toxicity (young age, high-grade tumor, lymph node involvement). A balanced discussion of the risks and benefits associated with OFS is critical, including the potential side effects of premature menopause. In two randomized trials (TEXT and SOFT), premenopausal patients with HR-positive early-stage breast cancer were assigned to receive AI (exemestane) plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS for a period of 5 years.314 Suppression of ovarian estrogen production was achieved with the use of GnRH agonist triptorelin, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation."

In two randomized trials (TEXT and SOFT), premenopausal patients with HR-positive early-stage breast cancer were assigned to receive AI (exemestane) plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS for a period of 5 years.314 Suppression of ovarian estrogen production was achieved with the use of GnRH agonist triptorelin, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation. The DFS was 92.8% in the exemestane plus OFS as compared with 88.8% in the tamoxifen plus OFS (HR for recurrence, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.550.80; P  .001).314 The OS did not differ significantly between the two groups (HR for death in the exemestane plus OFS group, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.861.51; P  .37).314 A 9-year median follow-up analysis of the TEXT-SOFT trials showed sustained improvements in DFS with exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen plus OFS (HR- 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.90) and in distant recurrence-free interval but not OS (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.22).315 Ultimately, with longer follow-up (median  13 years), an OS was demonstrated for OFS  exemestane in patients with high-risk of recurrence, but not in .exemestane plus OFS in patients with lower risk of relapse not receiving chemotherapy.316 The benefit of OFS in premenopausal patients with high-risk of recurrence was also seen in the results of the ASTRRA trial. This trial studied premenopausal patients (n 1483) with HR-positive breast cancer younger than 45 years treated with surgery and who received chemotherapy (as adjuvant or preoperative therapy) and received 5 years of tamoxifen alone or 5 years of tamoxifen with OFS for 2 years.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-37 tamoxifen plus OFS was 85.4% versus 80.2% with tamoxifen alone (HR- 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.87).317 The results of the TEXT-SOFT trials suggest an optimal OFS duration of 5 years and data from the ASTRA trial suggests a benefit with a minimum of at least 2 years of OFS. The NCCN Panel has included OFS plus endocrine therapy for 5 years as an option for premenopausal patients with HRpositive breast cancer at higher risk of recurrence (eg, young age, high-grade tumor, lymph-node involvement). Premenopausal patients wishing to continue adjuvant endocrine therapy after ovarian suppression is stopped should continue with tamoxifen versus AI. Duration of Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adjuvant endocrine therapy is recommended for a minimum of 5 years."

Premenopausal patients wishing to continue adjuvant endocrine therapy after ovarian suppression is stopped should continue with tamoxifen versus AI. Duration of Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adjuvant endocrine therapy is recommended for a minimum of 5 years. A recent retrospective analysis by the Oxford University studied risk of recurrence for years 5 through 20 after 5 years of endocrine therapy. 318 These data showed a considerable risk of recurrence between years 5 and 20 in these patients treated with initial 5 years of endocrine therapy.318 Data has now emerged showing benefit of extended endocrine therapy in improving DFS. Data from the ATLAS trial (discussed above)291 and the aTTom trial confirm greater reduction in recurrence and death from breast cancer with 10 versus 5 years of tamoxifen therapy.292 For those treated initially with adjuvant tamoxifen, there is evidence for benefit from extended adjuvant endocrine therapy from several randomized trials. Results of the MA-17 trial in 5187 patients who had completed 4.5 to 6 years of adjuvant tamoxifen demonstrated that extended therapy with letrozole provides benefit in postmenopausal patients with HR-positive, early-stage breast cancer.295,319 With a median follow-up of 64 months, letrozole was associated with improved DFS (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.45-0.61) and an improved OS (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52-0.71) compared with placebo.320 In a separate cohort analysis of the MA-17 trial, the efficacy of letrozole versus placebo was evaluated after un-blinding of the study in the 1579 patients who had been randomly assigned to placebo after 4.5 to 6 years of tamoxifen.321,322 The median time since completion of tamoxifen was 2.8 years. Both DFS and distant DFS were significantly improved in the group receiving letrozole, thereby providing some evidence for the efficacy of letrozole in patients who had received 4.5 to 6 years of tamoxifen therapy followed by no endocrine therapy for an extended period. A formal quality-of-life analysis demonstrated reasonable preservation of quality of life during extended endocrine therapy, although patients may experience ongoing menopausal symptoms and loss of bone mineral density.323,324 No data are available regarding use of aromatase inhibitors for more than 5 years or long-term toxic effects from extended treatment. In addition, the ATLAS trial data do not provide clear direction for treatment of postmenopausal patients.291 There are no data available to suggest that an AI for 5 years is better for long-term benefit than 10 years of tamoxifen."

In the extension study of ABCSG trial 6, HR-positive postmenopausal patients received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen and were randomized to 3 years of anastrozole or no further therapy.325 At a median follow-up of 62.3 months, patients who received anastrozole (n  387) were reported to have a statistically significantly reduced risk of recurrence compared with patients who received no further treatment (n  469; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.400.96; P  .031).325 The differences in design and patient populations among the studies of the aromatase inhibitors do not allow for the direct comparison of the results of these studies.

In patients initially treated with an AI, a randomized phase III trial (MA17.R) evaluated the effects of extending adjuvant AI therapy from 5 to 10 years.327 Postmenopausal patients who had completed 4.5 to 6 years of therapy with an AI (with a median duration of prior tamoxifen of 5 years), were randomized to letrozole or placebo for an additional 5 years.327 Improvement was seen in five-year DFS in those receiving letrozole compared to those who received placebo (95% 95% CI 93 - 96% vs. 91% 95% CI 89 -93%). The annual rate of contralateral breast cancer reported was lower with letrozole (0.49% vs. 0.21%; HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.81%).

When considering endocrine therapy, the Panel recommends the following adjuvant endocrine therapy options for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Postmenopausal Patients: The NCCN Panel recommends AI as initial adjuvant therapy for 5 years (category 1); and tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years followed by one of the following options: an AI to complete 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (category 1) or 5 years of AI therapy (category 2B); or tamoxifen for 4.5 to 6 years followed by 5 years of AI (category 1) or consideration of tamoxifen for up to 10 years. In postmenopausal patients, the use of tamoxifen alone for 5 years (category 1) or up to 10 years is limited to those who decline or who have a contraindication to AIs. Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Premenopausal Patients: If premenopausal at diagnosis, the NCCN Panel recommend 5 years of tamoxifen alone (category 1) or tamoxifen with OFS (category 1) or OFS plus AI for 5 years (category 1). Patients who are premenopausal at diagnosis and who become amenorrheic with chemotherapy may have continued estrogen production from the ovaries without menses. To assure a true postmenopausal status, serial assessment of circulating LH, FSH, and estradiol is mandatory when considering this subset for AI therapy.330,331 Frequency of testing of estradiol and FSHLH levels should be individualized."

After 5 years of initial endocrine therapy, for patients who are postmenopausal at that time (including those who have become postmenopausal during the 5 years of tamoxifen therapy), the NCCN Panel recommends considering extended therapy with an AI for up to 5 years (category 1) or based on the data from the ATLAS trial considering tamoxifen for an additional 5 years. For those who remain premenopausal after the initial 5 years of tamoxifen, the panel recommends considering continuing up to 10 years of tamoxifen therapy. Additional considerations during Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy: Symptom management for patients on adjuvant endocrine therapies often requires treatment of hot flashes and the treatment of concurrent depression. Venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) has been studied and is an effective intervention in decreasing hot flashes.332- 335 There is evidence suggesting that concomitant use of tamoxifen with certain SSRIs (eg, paroxetine, fluoxetine) may decrease plasma levels of Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:19 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-39 endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen.336,337 These SSRIsSNRIs may interfere with the enzymatic conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen by inhibiting a particular isoform of cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) enzyme. Individuals with wild-type CYP2D6 alleles are classified as extensive metabolizers of tamoxifen. Those with one or two variant alleles with either reduced or no activity are designated as intermediate metabolizers and poor metabolizers, respectively. The mild CYP2D6 inhibitors such as citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine appear to have no or only minimal effect on tamoxifen metabolism.330,338,339 With respect to CYP2D6 mutation status, a large retrospective study of 1325 patients found that time to disease recurrence was significantly shortened in poor metabolizers of tamoxifen.340 However, the BIG 1-98 trial reported on the outcome based on CYP2D6 genotype in a subset of postmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive, early invasive breast cancer."

The study found no correlation between CYP2D6 allelic status and disease outcome or between CYP2D6 allelic status and tamoxifen-related adverse effects.341 A genetic analysis of the ATAC trial found no association between CYP2D6 genotype and clinical outcomes.342,343 Given the limited and conflicting evidence at this time,344 the NCCN Breast Cancer Panel does not recommend CYP2D6 testing as a tool to determine the optimal adjuvant endocrine strategy. This recommendation is consistent with the ASCO Guidelines.345 When prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), it is reasonable to avoid potent and intermediate CYP2D6 inhibiting agents, particularly paroxetine and fluoxetine, if an appropriate alternative exists. For those on tamoxifen, while age-appropriate gynecologic screening is recommended, the use of routine annual pelvic ultrasound is not recommended. For those receiving AI or who experience ovarian failure secondary to treatment should have monitoring of bone health with a bone mineral density determination at baseline and periodically thereafter. .The panel discourages the selective ER modulators to treat osteoporosis or osteopenia in patients with breast cancer. The use of a bisphosphonate (oralIV) or denosumab is recommended to maintain or to improve bone mineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural or induced) patients receiving adjuvant AI therapy. Factors to consider for duration of anti- osteoporosis therapy include bone mineral density, response to therapy, and risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture. There are case reports of spontaneous fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Patients treated with bisphosphonates or denosumab should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D."

The incremental benefit of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine therapy in patients with low clinical risk of recurrence such as those with very small, low grade, lymph node-negative tumors is relatively small.346 The decision whether or not to administer adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors is based on many factors including lymph node status, size, grade, lymphovascular invasion, age, comorbid conditions andor the results of a gene expression profile test using multigene assays. Several commercially-available gene-based assays are useful in determining prognosis by predicting distant recurrence, local recurrence, or survival.

This assay appears to be useful in identifying a subgroup of patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors with very low risk of recurrence without adjuvant chemotherapy and helpful in identifying patients at low risk for a late recurrence.363 Based on results of two Austrian Breast Cancer Study Group trials- ABCSG-6 and ABCSG-8, patients with HR-positive, HER-2 negative, and lymph-node node-negative disease with a low-risk score by the 12-gene assay had risk of distant recurrence of 4% at 10 years.363 The prognostic value of the risk score from the 12-gene assay was found to be independent of conventional clinicopathological factors.

Breast Cancer Index: The Breast Cancer Index (BCI) is a combination of two profiles, the HOXB13-to-IL17BR expression ratio (H:I ratio) and the Molecular Grade Index (MGI). Compared with clinical prognostic factors (eg, age, tumor size, tumor grade, and lymph node status), the H:I ratio has been shown to be prognostic in the setting of adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy.362,364 The addition of MGI to H:I was determined to provide additional prognostic discrimination, leading to the BCI assay.364 In a secondary analysis of the ATAC trial, BCI was prognostic in node negative breast cancer for both early (years 0-5) and late (years 5-10) distant recurrence.365 For patients with T1 and T2 HR-positive, HER2-negative, and lymph node-negative tumors, a BCI in the low-risk range, regardless of T size, places the tumor into the same prognostic category as T1a-T1b, N0, M0. Secondary analyses of the MA.17, Trans-aTTom, and IDEAL trials showed that in patients with HR-positive T1T3 tumors that are lymph-node negative or positive, those that had a high BCI (HI) demonstrated significant improvements in DFS when adjuvant endocrine therapy was extended, compared to the control arm.366-368 Considering the ability of the multigene assays to predict benefit of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy and ability to determine prognosis by predicting risk of distant recurrence, the NCCN Panel has summarized the treatment implications based on risk scores and nodal status. Multigene Assays for Axillary Lymph Node-Negative HR-Positive, HER2-Negative Tumors Small tumors (up to 0.5 cm in greatest diameter) that do not involve the lymph nodes have a favorable prognosis so adjuvant chemotherapy is not recommended. According to the NCCN Panel, adjuvant endocrine therapy may be considered in this group of patients to reduce the risk for a second contralateral breast cancer, as well as the small benefit in reducing the risk of localregional and distant recurrence.(Category 2B). For patients with invasive ductal or lobular tumors greater than 0.5 cm in diameter and no lymph node involvement (lymph node node-negative), the NCCN panel recommends strongly considering the 21-gene RT-PCR assay to help estimate likelihood of recurrence and benefit from chemotherapy (category 1)."

The panel has noted that on an exploratory analysis from the TAILORx study,353 adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered in patients 50 years of age or younger with a 21-gene RS of 16-25. Also, patients with T1b tumors with low grade histology should be considered for endocrine monotherapy, as the TAILORx study353 did not include patients with such tumors. The panel notes that other prognostic multigene assays may be considered to help estimate risk of recurrence, but these assays have not been validated to predict the benefit of systemic chemotherapy. NCCN Guidelines and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-43 amongst the other assays, the panel has listed the 70-gene assay as a category 1 option based on the results of the prospective MINDACT359 trial demonstrating the ability of the 70-gene assay to identify a good genomic risk population despite a high clinical risk, in whom chemotherapy may be omitted without a detrimental effect. High clinical risk in the MINDACT trial was defined for grade 1 tumors as 3 cm N0 or T2N1, for grade 2 tumors T2N0-1, and for grade 3 tumors T1c-2N0-1. Furthermore, given no difference in outcomes with or without chemotherapy in the discordant low clinical riskhigh genomic risk group, the MINDACT study suggests that the 70-gene panel is not useful guiding systemic chemotherapy decisions in this subgroup of patients. Since results of different assays may not be concordant with each other and these assays have not been compared head-to-head prospectively, clinicians should only order one of the available assays for a specific patient and tumor. Multigene Assays for Axillary Lymph Node-Positive HR- Positive, HER2-Negative Tumors For patients with four or more involved nodes the panel recommends systemic adjuvant chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy (category 1). Patients with less than four involved nodes or with pN1mi and less than or equal to 2 mm axillary node metastasis, are most often candidates for chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy."

Patients with less than four involved nodes or with pN1mi and less than or equal to 2 mm axillary node metastasis, are most often candidates for chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy. The panel recommends that clinical decision making for adjuvant chemotherapy be based on elements of clinical risk stratification such as clinical characteristics, tumor stage, pathology and comorbid conditions. If the patient is not a candidate for chemotherapy, the panel recommends adjuvant endocrine therapy alone (category 2A). For those who are candidates for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy based on clinical characteristics, tumor stage, and pathology, the panel recommends consideration of multigene assays to assess prognosis as a tool to assist with treatment decision making. The panel notes in those with N1mi and N1 tumors, while multigene assays have yet to be proven to be predictive for adjuvant chemotherapy benefit, they are prognostic and can be used to identify low-risk patients who are likely to derive little or no absolute benefit from addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to adjuvant endocrine therapy. A secondary analysis of the prospective SWOG 8814 trial using the 21-gene assay demonstrated no benefit for chemotherapy for patients with 1-3 involved axillary lymph nodes and a low RS, and a significant benefit for the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy in those with high-RS ( 31).350 The phase III RxPONDER trial prospectively demonstrated that for premenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative, node-positive breast cancer , a 21-gene assay Recurrence Scores up to 25 had an addition benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine therapy for improving invasive diseasefree survival .358 In the MINDACT trial, among patients with 1-3 positive nodes who had a high clinical risk of recurrence but low risk by the 70-gene assay, the rates of survival were similar between those who received adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy versus those received adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, suggesting that chemotherapy could be omitted in this group.359 Other multigene assays have not proven to be predictive of benefit from chemotherapy.

Adjuvant CDK 46 inhibitors: In the MonarchE study, the addition of 2 years of abemaciclib to endocrine therapy reduced the absolute risk of recurrence at 4 years by 6.4% (HR 0.664, 95% CI 0.578-0.762, P  .0001) in patients with HR-positiveHER2-negative, high-risk breast cancer, defined as 4 or more pathologically involved lymph nodes confirmed preoperatively andor at surgery, or 13 pathologically involved lymph nodes with additional high risk features (grade 3 or size 5 cm based on pre-operative imaging andor pathologically at surgery).369 Two trials of palbociclib as adjuvant therapy in HR-positive, HER2 negative early breast cancer did not show benefit of adding palbociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy in terms of invasive disease-free survival.370,371 The results from the NATALEE trial reported after a median follow-up of 34 months, showed a statistically significant improvement (3.3%) in invasive disease-free survival with the addition of ribociclib to adjuvant endocrine therapy (HR-0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P  .003).) for stage II and stage III HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.372 Additional follow-up is needed to characterize the long-term efficacy of ribociclib in this setting. According to the current guidelines, 2 years of adjuvant CDK 46 therapy with abemaciclib should be considered in combination with endocrine therapy in patients with HR-positiveHER2-negative, high-risk breast cancer (as detailed above). Adjuvant Olaparib: In patients with germline BRCA 12 mutations and high-risk HER2-negative tumors, the results of the OlympiA trial showed that the 4-year OS in the group that received 1 year of adjuvant olaparib was 89.8% and 86.4% in the placebo group (95% CI -0.1% -6.8%). The 4- year invasive DFS for the olaparib group versus placebo group was 82.7% versus 75.4% (95% CI 3.0% - 11.5%) and 4-year distant DFS was 86.5% versus 79.1% (95% CI 3.6% -11.3%).373 According to the NCCN panel, addition of adjuvant olaparib for 1 year may be considered for those with germline BRCA 12 mutations in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors with 4 positive lymph nodes after adjuvant chemotherapy or residual disease after preoperative therapy and a clinical stage, pathologic stage, ER status, and tumor grade (CPSEG) score 3 (category 2A)."

In patients eligible for both adjuvant olaparib and abemaciclib, the optimal sequencing is not known. (For sequencing of olaparib andor abemaciclib with RT, see BINV-I on nccn.org) Adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy Antiresorptive agents (bisphosphonates and denosumab) have an established role as preventative and therapeutic agents for the management of osteoporosis, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and bone metastases. Bisphosphonates: In the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group trial-12 (ABCSG-12) trial, for patients over 40 years, zoledronic acid significantly reduced the risk of recurrence by 34% (HR, 0.66; P.014) and the risk of death by 49% (HR, 0.51; P.020). However, no improvement was seen in either DFS or OS in this post hoc analysis among patients under 40 years.374 In a planned subgroup analysis of the AZURE trial, zoledronic acid improved DFS in patients who were more than 5 years since menopause at trial entry.375 A meta-analysis of data from seven adjuvant bisphosphonate trials (AZURE, ABCSG-12, ZO-FAST, Z-FAST, EZO-FAST, NSABP-B34, GAIN), including only those known to be over 50 years, postmenopausal, or with ovarian suppression, showed a significant Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:19 AM.

However, in postmenopausal patients, zoledronic acid significantly reduced bone recurrence (3.4% vs. 4.5%, RR0.73, 99% CI 0.53 to 1.00); the difference in breast cancer mortality was not statistically significant (7.1% vs. 7.9%, RR0.88, 99% CI 0.69 to 1.11).377 Denosumab: In the adjuvant setting, the ABCSG-18 trial studied the effect of denosumab in postmenopausal patients treated with adjuvant AIs and showed a reduction in clinical fractures (HR 0.5, P  .0001), which was the primary endpoint of this study.378 The final analysis after a median follow- up of 8 years continued to show a benefit with denosumab. Adjuvant denosumab improved bone metastasis-free survival (88.9 vs. 86.4%; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.00) and OS (90.9 vs. 89.9%; HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.01).379 In contrast, results of the phase III trial (D-Care) trial failed to demonstrate a difference in bone metastasis-free survival in those receiving denosumab versus placebo.380 Due to these conflicting results from phase III trials, denosumab is currently not recommended in the adjuvant setting.379 The panel recommends considering adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy for risk reduction of distant metastasis for 35 years in patients with high-risk node negative or node-positive tumors. Adjuvant Therapy for HER2-negative tumors Several combination chemotherapy regimens are appropriate to consider for HR-positive or negative and HER2-negative tumors. All adjuvant chemotherapy regimens listed in the NCCN Guidelines have been evaluated in phase III clinical trials and are category 1 unless otherwise noted. Preferred Regimens Regimens listed as preferred include dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed or preceded by paclitaxel either weekly or biweekly; docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide (TC); olaparib for germline BRCA 12 mutations; pembrolizumab for high-risk ER- disease; and capecitabine for residual ER- disease after preoperative chemotherapy."

The results show no significant difference between the two chemotherapy regimens but demonstrate a 26% reduction in hazard of recurrence (P  .01) and a 31% reduction in the hazard of death (P  .013) for the dose-dense regimens.384 The ECOG E1199 study was a four-arm trial that randomized 4950 patients to receive AC chemotherapy followed by either paclitaxel or docetaxel given by either an every-3-week schedule or a weekly schedule.385 In a secondary series of comparisons, weekly paclitaxel was superior to every-3-week paclitaxel in DFS (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.031.57; P  .006) and OS (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.021.72; P  .01), and every-3-week docetaxel was superior to every-3-week paclitaxel in DFS (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.001.52; P  .02) but not in OS.385 Based on these results, as well as the findings from the CALGB trial 9741 that showed dose-dense AC followed by paclitaxel every 2 weeks to have a survival benefit when compared with the regimen of AC followed by every-3-week paclitaxel,384 the every-3-week paclitaxel regimen has been removed from the guidelines.

At a median follow-up of 73 months, results from the 3-arm randomized NSABP B-30 trial comparing TAC versus AT versus AC followed by docetaxel (AC followed by T) demonstrated that AC followed by T had a significant advantage in DFS (HR, 0.83; P  .006) but not in OS (HR, 0.86; P  .086) when compared with TAC. In addition, both DFS (HR, 0.080; P  .001) and OS (HR, 0.83; P  .034) were significantly increased when AC followed by T was compared with AT, with AT demonstrating non-inferiority compared with TAC.392 Useful in Certain Circumstances: Regimens included in this category include dose dense AC; AC every 3 weeks (Category 2B); CMF; AC followed by weekly paclitaxel; and capecitabine as maintenance therapy for TNBC after adjuvant chemotherapy. The phase III E1199 trial compared patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer who received 4 cycles of AC every 3 weeks, followed by either paclitaxel or docetaxel, either weekly or every 3 weeks. The 10-year updated results of this trial showed that incorporation of weekly paclitaxel and docetaxel every 3 weeks was associated with significant improvements in DFS, and marginal improvements in OS, compared with paclitaxel given every 3 weeks.

The panel recommends HER2-targeted therapy in patients with HER2-positive tumors (see Principles of HER2 Testing in the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer).

Some support for this recommendation comes from studies showing a higher risk of recurrence for patients with HER2-positive, node-negative tumors less than or equal to 1 cm compared to those with HER2-negative tumors of the same size.399 Ten-year breast cancer-specific survival and 10-year recurrence-free survival were 85% and 75%, respectively, in patients with tumors characterized as HER2-positive, ER-positive tumors, and 70% and 61%, respectively, in patients with HER2-positive, ER-negative tumors."

With respect to a duration less than 12 months, the results of the PERSEPHONE trial showed non-inferiority for 6 months versus 12 months of trastuzumab treatment,423 However, the PHARE study observed more events in the 6 month cohort compared to the 12 month cohort, and non- inferiority was not established.424 Furthermore, adverse events over time Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:19 AM. NCCN Guidelines and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-51 remained similar in both arms, and comparable to data reported in other trials. Considering the conflicting results between PERSEPHONE and PHARE, in addition to the protocol design of the majority of the randomized trials establishing the benefits of trastuzumab which utilized 12 months of therapy, the NCCN panel recommends up to one year of HER2-targeted therapy with trastuzumab. Based on the updated APHINITY trial data, the addition of pertuzumab may be considered with trastuzumab in those with node-positive disease."

Based on the updated APHINITY trial data, the addition of pertuzumab may be considered with trastuzumab in those with node-positive disease. Increased cardiac toxicity has been observed in patients treated with trastuzumab.412,425,426 In addition, anthracycline and taxane-based regimens in combination with HER2-targeted agents are associated with further increased risk of cardiac toxicity.427 The panel recommends evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to and during treatment. The optimal frequency of LVEF assessment during adjuvant trastuzumab therapy is not known. The FDA label recommends LVEF measurements prior to initiation of trastuzumab and every 3 months during therapy. According to the panel, use of a FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab. Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase- oysk injection approved for subcutaneous use may be substituted for intravenous trastuzumab. It is important to note that it has a different dosage and administration compared to intravenous trastuzumab. Adjuvant Therapy for Tumors of Favorable Histologies The guidelines provide systemic treatment recommendations for the favorable histology of invasive breast cancers (including pure tubular and pure mucinous cancers, pure cribriform, adenoid cystic secretory carcinoma and other salivary carcinoma, rare low-grade forms of metaplastic carcinoma) based on ERPR status, tumor size and ALN status. If used, the treatment options for endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and sequencing of treatment with other modalities are similar to those of the usual histology of breast cancers. There are rare subtypes of metaplastic carcinoma (eg, low-grade adenosquamous and low-grade fibromatosis-like carcinoma) that have a favorable prognosis even without administration of adjuvant systemic therapies. The vast majority of pure tubular, pure mucinous, and pure cribriform breast cancers are both ER-positive and HER2-negative. To be associated with favorable prognosis, the favorable histologic type should not be high grade, should be pure (90% as classified on the surgical excision, not core biopsy alone), and should be HER-2 negative. If atypical pathologic or clinical features are present, consider treating as ductalNST."

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-52 Post-Therapy Surveillance and Follow-up for T03, N1, M0 and T13, N01, M0 Tumors Post-therapy follow-up is optimally performed by members of the treatment team and includes the performance of regular historyphysical examinations every 4 to 6 months for the first 5 years after primary therapy and annually thereafter. Regarding frequency of mammograms after BCS followed by radiation, the NCCN Panel agrees with ASTROs Choosing Wisely list of recommendations released in 2014.428 The recommendations state that annual mammograms are the appropriate frequency for surveillance of breast cancer patients who have had BCS and RT with no clear advantage to shorter interval imaging. Patients should wait 6 to 12 months after the completion of RT to begin their annual mammogram surveillance. Suspicious findings on physical examination or surveillance imaging might warrant a shorter interval between mammograms. The NCCN Panel notes that any imaging of reconstructed breast is not indicated. According to the NCCN Panel, in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of recurrent disease, laboratory or imaging studies to screen for metastasis are not necessary."

The routine performance of alkaline phosphatase tests and LFTs are not included in the guidelines.429- 431 In addition, the Panel notes no evidence to support the use of tumor markers for breast cancer, and routine bone scans, CT scans, MRI scans, PET scans, or ultrasound examinations in the asymptomatic patient provide no advantage in survival or ability to palliate recurrent disease and are, therefore, not recommended.110,432 The use of breast MRI in follow-up of patients with prior breast cancer is undefined. It may be considered as an option in patients with high lifetime risk (20% based on models largely dependent on family history) of developing a second primary breast cancer. Rates of contralateral breast cancer after either breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy have been reported to be increased in patients with BRCA12 mutations when compared with patients with sporadic breast cancer.433-435 The Panel recommends that patients with intact uteri who are taking adjuvant tamoxifen should have yearly gynecologic assessments and rapid evaluation of any vaginal spotting that might occur because of the risk of tamoxifen-associated endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal patients.436 The performance of routine endometrial biopsy or ultrasonography in the asymptomatic woman is not recommended. Neither test has demonstrated utility as a screening test in any population of patients. The vast majority of patients with tamoxifen-associated uterine carcinoma have early vaginal spotting. If an adjuvant AI is considered in patients with amenorrhea following treatment, baseline levels of estradiol and gonadotropin followed by serial monitoring of these hormones should be performed if endocrine therapy with an AI is initiated.330 Bilateral oophorectomy assures postmenopausal status in young patients with therapy-induced amenorrhea and may be considered prior to initiating therapy with an AI in a young woman.

Venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), has been studied and is an effective intervention in decreasing hot flashes.332-335 There is evidence suggesting that concomitant use of tamoxifen with certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (eg, paroxetine, fluoxetine) may decrease plasma levels of endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen.336,337 These SSRIsSNRIs may interfere with the enzymatic conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen by inhibiting a particular isoform of CYP2D6.

Predictors of poor adherence to medication include the presence of side effects associated with the medication, and incomplete understanding by the patient of the benefits associated with regular administration of the medication.437 The Panel recommends the implementation of simple strategies to enhance patient adherence to endocrine therapy, such as direct questioning of the patient during office visits, as well as brief, clear explanations on the value of taking the medication regularly and the therapeutic importance of longer durations of endocrine therapy. Factors associated with increased risk of lymphedema include extent of axillary surgery, axillary radiation, infection, and patient obesity.438,439 The Panel recommends educating the patients on lymphedema, monitoring for lymphedema, and referring for lymphedema management as needed.

Many young patients treated for breast cancer maintain or regain premenopausal status following treatment for breast cancer. For these patients, the NCCN Panel discourages the use of hormonal birth control methods, regardless of the HR status of the tumor.440 Alternative birth control methods are recommended, including intrauterine devices, barrier methods, and, for those with no intent of future pregnancy, tubal ligation or vasectomy. Breastfeeding during endocrine or chemotherapy treatment is not recommended by the NCCN Panel because of risks to the infant. Breastfeeding after breast-conserving treatment for breast cancer is not contraindicated. However, lactation from an irradiated breast may not be possible, or may occur only with a diminished capacity.440,441 The Panel recommends that patients on an adjuvant AI or who experience ovarian failure secondary to treatment should have monitoring of bone health with a bone mineral density determination at baseline and periodically thereafter. The use of estrogen, progesterone, or selective ER modulators to treat osteoporosis or osteopenia in patients with breast cancer is discouraged. The use of a bisphosphonate is generally the preferred intervention to improve bone mineral density. A single phase 3 study, ABCSG12, demonstrated improved outcomes with the addition of zoledronic acid in premenopausal patients receiving endocrine therapy with ovarian suppression.442 Use of bisphosphonates in such patients and in other subgroups remains controversial. Denosumab has shown to significantly reduce fractures in postmenopausal patients receiving adjuvant therapy AIs, and improves bone mineral density.378 Optimal duration of bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. Factors to consider for duration of anti-osteoporosis therapy include bone mineral density, response to therapy, and risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture. Patients treated with a bisphosphonate should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D. Evidence suggests that a healthy lifestyle may lead to better breast cancer outcomes."

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-55 RecurrentStage IV Breast Cancer Staging and Workup for Recurrent and Stage IV Breast Cancer The staging evaluation of patients who present with recurrent or stage IV breast cancer includes: history and physical examination; the performance of a CBC, LFTs, chest diagnostic CT, bone scan, and radiographs of any long or weight-bearing bones that are painful or appear abnormal on bone scan; diagnostic CT of the abdomen (with or without diagnostic CT of the pelvis) or MRI scan of the abdomen; and biopsy documentation of first recurrence if possible. The NCCN Panel generally discourages the use of sodium fluoride PET or PETCT scans for the evaluation of patients with recurrent disease. There is limited evidence (mostly from retrospective studies) to support the use of PETCT scanning to guide treatment planning through determination of the extent of disease in select patients with recurrent or metastatic disease.110,111,449,450 In general, the non-diagnostic CT scans used for PET under-evaluate the lungs and the liver compared with contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT scans. The Panel considers biopsy of equivocal or suspicious sites to be more likely than PETCT scanning to provide accurate staging information in this patient population. The consensus of the NCCN Panel is that FDG-PETCT is optional and most helpful in situations where standard imaging results are equivocal or suspicious. The NCCN Panel recommends bone scan or sodium fluoride PETCT (category 2B) to detect bone metastases. However, if the FDG- PET results clearly indicate bone metastases, these scans can be omitted. The NCCN Panel recommends that metastatic disease at presentation or first recurrence of disease should be biopsied as a part of the workup for patients with recurrent or stage IV disease. This ensures accurate determination of metastaticrecurrent disease and tumor histology, and allows for biomarker determination and selection of appropriate treatment."

This ensures accurate determination of metastaticrecurrent disease and tumor histology, and allows for biomarker determination and selection of appropriate treatment. Soft tissue tumor biopsy is preferred over bone sites unless a portion of the biopsy can be protected from harsh decalcification solution to preserve more accurate biomarker assessment. Determination of HR status (ER and PR) and HER2 status should be repeated in all cases when diagnostic tissue is obtained. ER and PR assays may be falsely negative or falsely positive, and there may be discordance between the primary and metastatic tumors.451,452 The reasons for the discordance may relate to change in biology of disease, differential effect of prior treatment on clonal subsets, tumor heterogeneity, or imperfect accuracy and reproducibility of assays.452 Discordance between the receptor status of primary and recurrent disease has been reported in a number of studies. The discordance rates are in the range of 3.4% to 60% for ER-negative to ER-positive; 7.2% to 31% for ER-positive to ER-negative; and 0.7% to 11% for HER2.453-462 The NCCN Panel recommends that re-testing the receptor status of recurrent disease be performed, especially in cases when it was previously unknown, originally negative, or not overexpressed. For patients with clinical courses consistent with HRpositive breast cancer, or with prior positive HR results, the Panel has noted that a course of endocrine therapy is reasonable, regardless of whether the receptor assay is repeated or the result of the most recent HR assay. Genetic counseling is recommended if the patient is considered to be at high risk for hereditary breast cancer, as defined by the NCCN Guidelines for GeneticFamilial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic. Genetic testing: In the metastatic setting, results from genetic testing may have therapeutic implications. Germline mutations in BRCA12 have proven clinical utility and therapeutic impact.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-56 Management of Locally Recurrent Disease Patients with local recurrence only are divided into three groups: 1) those who had been treated initially by mastectomy alone; 2) those who had been treated initially by mastectomy plus RT; and 3) those who had received breast-conserving therapy plus RT. In one retrospective study of local recurrence patterns in patients with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy without RT, the most common sites of local recurrence were at the chest wall and the supraclavicular lymph nodes.463 The recommendations for treatment of the population of patients experiencing a local recurrence only are supported by analyses of a combined database of patients from the EORTC 10801 and Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 82TM trials. The analyses compared breast-conserving therapy with mastectomy in patients with stage I and stage II disease. The 133 (approximately 8%) patients experiencing a local recurrence as an initial event were approximately equally divided between those who had undergone mastectomy and those who had received breast-conserving therapy as initial treatment for breast cancer. Of those in the former group, 51 (76%) were able to undergo RT with or without surgery as treatment for local disease recurrence. No difference in survival emerged between patients receiving treatment after initial treatment with mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy; approximately 50% of both groups were alive at 10-year follow-up.464 According to the NCCN Panel, mastectomy-treated patients should undergo surgical resection of the local recurrence (if it can be accomplished with limited morbidity) and involved-field RT to the chest wall and supraclavicular area (if the chest wall was not previously treated or if additional RT may be safely administered). The use of surgical resection in this setting implies the use of limited excision of disease with the goal of obtaining clear margins of resection. Unresectable chest wall recurrent disease should be treated with RT if no prior radiation has been given."

Unresectable chest wall recurrent disease should be treated with RT if no prior radiation has been given. In patients with a local breast recurrence after BCS and RT who had a prior sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, a repeat SLNB may be considered although the accuracy of repeat SLNB is unproven, and the prognostic significance of repeat SLNB after mastectomy is unknown and its use is discouraged.465,466 On the other hand, the prognostic significance of repeat SLNB after mastectomy is unknown and its use is discouraged. The consensus recommendation of the Panel for most patients with a local recurrence following breast-conserving therapy and SLNB is mastectomy and a level III axillary dissection. The results of the CALOR trial found that after complete resection in patients with isolated locoregional recurrence, adjuvant chemotherapy improves both DFS and OS.467 After a median follow-up of 4.9 years, the overall DFS was 69% in the chemotherapy group versus 57% in the group that did not receive chemotherapy (HR, 0.59; P  .046).467 Five-year OS in all patients in the study was also significantly improved with chemotherapy (88% vs. 76%, P  .024).467 The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was mostly seen in patients with ER-negative disease. Among patients with ER-negative disease, 5-year DFS was 67% versus 35% (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.140.73) and in those ER-positive disease, the 5-year DFS was 70% versus 69% (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.471.89).467 However these patients received endocrine therapy. According to the NCCN Panel, after local treatment, patients with local recurrences only should be considered for limited duration systemic chemotherapy or endocrine therapy similar to that outlined in the adjuvant chemotherapy section.

NCCN recognizes the importance of clinical trials and encourages participation when applicable and available. Surgery for Recurrent or Stage IV Disease The primary treatment approach recommended by the NCCN Panel for patients with metastatic breast cancer and an intact primary tumor is systemic therapy, with consideration of surgery after initial systemic treatment for those requiring palliation of symptoms or with impending complications, such as skin ulceration, bleeding, fungation, and pain.468 Generally such surgery should be undertaken only if complete local clearance of tumor may be obtained and if other sites of disease are not immediately life-threatening. Often such surgery requires collaboration between the breast surgeon and the reconstructive surgeon to provide optimal cancer control and wound closure."

Retrospective studies suggest a potential survival benefit from complete excision of the in-breast tumor in select patients with metastatic breast cancer.469-472 Substantial selection biases exist in all of these studies and are likely to confound the study results.473,474 Two prospective, randomized studies assessed whether or not surgery on the primary tumor in the breast is necessary for patients who are diagnosed with metastaticstage IV breast cancer.475,476 In the first prospective trial, patients (n  350) with de novo metastatic breast cancer who achieved a partial or complete response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to either surgery of the primary tumor plus adjuvant radiation or no locoregional treatment.475 There was no difference in the OS between the group that received surgery and the group that did not (19.2 vs. 20.5 months; HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.811.34).475 In a separate multicenter prospective registry study patients whose disease responded to first-line systemic therapy were randomized to management of the primary tumor by surgery or not. 477 Preliminary data showed no difference in OS between the two groups 477 However, in another trial by the Turkish Federation (MF07-01), patients (n  274) with de novo metastatic breast cancer who were randomized to local management (mastectomy, or BCS with radiation) followed by systemic therapy versus systemic therapy only observed a benefit with surgery.478 While no difference in survival was seen at 36 months, at 40 months, patients treated with local management showed an improvement in survival with locoregional treatment (46.4% vs. 26.4%; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.490.88).478 The design of this trial is different from the other, the first difference being the inclusion of two prospective studies described above in which patients were included only if they had experienced a response to systemic therapy."

Patients who received surgery had lower rates of triple-negative disease (7% vs. 17%), visceral metastases (29% vs. 45%), and many had solitary bone metastases only (33% vs. 20%).478 In an unplanned subgroup analysis, patients who appeared to derive the greatest OS benefit from local management included those with HR-positive disease (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.440.89; P  .008); those with HER2-negative disease (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.450.91; P  .01); those 55 years (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.380.86; P  .007); and those with solitary bone metastases (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.230.98; P  .04). 478 The Panel recognizes the need for more data from randomized clinical trials that will address the risks and benefits of local therapy for patients with stage IV disease while eliminating selection biases."

Guideline Stratification for Systemic Therapy for Stage IVRecurrent Disease The systemic treatment of breast cancer recurrence or stage IV disease prolongs survival and enhances QOL but is not curative. Thus, the use of the minimally toxic endocrine therapies is preferred to the use of cytotoxic therapy whenever reasonable.479 Guidance for treatment of patients with breast cancer and brain metastases is included the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers. Patients with recurrent or stage IV breast cancer at diagnosis are initially stratified according to whether bone metastases are present. These two patient subsets (those with and without bony metastases) are then further stratified by tumor HR and HER2 status. Therapy for Bone Metastases Complications from bone metastases include pain, decreased performance status, and decreased QOL, as well as skeletal-related events (SREs), which are defined as the need for radiation or surgery to bone, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. The NCCN Panel recommends treatment with a bone-modifying agent such as zoledronic acid, pamidronate, or denosumab (category 1) in addition to chemotherapy or endocrine therapy if bone metastasis is present; expected survival is 3 months. Patients should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to initiation of this therapy. The bisphosphonates and denosumab are associated with a risk of development of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)."

Patients should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to initiation of this therapy. The bisphosphonates and denosumab are associated with a risk of development of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Poor baseline dental health or dental procedures during treatment are known risk factors for ONJ. Thus, a dental examination with preventive dentistry intervention is recommended prior to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate or denosumab, and dental procedures invasive of gum or bone during treatment should be avoided if at all possible. Additional risk factors for the development of ONJ include administration of chemotherapy or corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene with periodontal disease and dental abscess.480 Bisphosphonates There are extensive data from randomized trials in support of the use of bisphosphonates for patients with metastatic disease to bone. The randomized clinical trial data include the use of zoledronic acid and pamidronate in the United States and ibandronate and clodronate in European countries.481-488 In metastatic bone disease, bisphosphonate treatment is associated with fewer SREs, fewer pathologic fractures, and less need for RT and surgery to treat bone pain. The data indicate that zoledronic acid and pamidronate may be given on a 3- to 4-week schedule in conjunction with antineoplastic therapy (ie, endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy) or every 12 weeks. Three randomized trials have compared zoledronic acid dosed every 4 weeks versus every 12 weeks.489-491 Data from these trials show that among patients with breast cancer and bone metastases zoledronic acid administered once every 12 weeks versus once every 4 weeks does not compromise efficacy and has similar rates of SREs.489,490,492 In the ZOOM trial,489 the rate of skeletal morbidities was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.140.29) in those receiving zoledronic acid every 4 weeks versus 0.26 (95% CI, 0.15 0.37) in those receiving zoledronic acid every 12 weeks.

In OPTIMIZE-2 trial,491 the rate of SREs was 22% in the 4-week arm and 23.2% in the 12-week arm.491 The NCCN Panel recommends an optimal dosing of every 12 weeks. The use of bisphosphonates should be accompanied by calcium and vitamin D supplementation with daily doses of calcium of 1200 to 1500 mg and vitamin D3 of 400 to 800 IU. Recommended agents for use in the United States are pamidronate 90 mg intravenously over 2 hours or zoledronic acid 4 mg intravenously over 15 minutes. The original studies continued treatment for up to 24 months; however, there are limited long-term safety data indicating treatment can continue beyond that time.484,486,493 The risk of renal toxicity necessitates monitoring of serum creatinine prior to administration of each dose and dose reduction or discontinuation if renal function is reduced. Current clinical trial results support the use of bisphosphonates for up to 2 years. Longer durations of bisphosphonate therapy may provide additional benefit, but this has not yet been tested in clinical trials. Denosumab Patients with metastatic breast cancer to bone who are candidates for bisphosphonate therapy may also be considered for treatment with denosumab. This recommendation is based on the results of a single randomized trial comparing denosumab to zoledronic acid.494 All trial patients were recommended to supplement with vitamin D and calcium. Patients on the experimental arm were given 120 mg of denosumab injected subcutaneously every 4 weeks plus intravenous placebo versus the control arm where patients were given an intravenous infusion of 4 mg of zoledronic acid every 4 weeks, and a subcutaneous placebo. In this trial with non-inferiority as the primary endpoint, denosumab was shown to significantly delay time to first SRE by 18% as compared with zoledronic acid (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.710.95; P  .001 for non-inferiority; P  .01 for superiority) and time to first and subsequent SREs (rate ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.660.89; P  .001). No difference in time to progression or OS was observed.494 Dosing of denosumab outside of every 3 to 6 weeks has not been studied. Systemic Therapy for Stage IV or Recurrent Metastatic HR-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer Patients with stage IV or recurrent disease characterized by HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors with no visceral crisis are treated with endocrine therapy alone or endocrine therapy in combination with targeted agents."

Systemic Therapy for Stage IV or Recurrent Metastatic HR-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer Patients with stage IV or recurrent disease characterized by HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors with no visceral crisis are treated with endocrine therapy alone or endocrine therapy in combination with targeted agents. Patients whose disease progresses after a year from the end of adjuvant endocrine-based therapy and those who present with de novo stage IVmetastatic breast cancer are eligible for first-line endocrine therapies. Many premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with HR-positive breast cancer benefit from sequential use of endocrine therapies at disease progression. Therefore, patients with breast cancers whose disease responds to an endocrine-based therapy with either shrinkage of the tumor or long-term disease stabilization (clinical benefit) should receive additional endocrine therapy at disease progression. For disease progression on or within 12 months of completing adjuvant endocrine therapy or for disease progression on first-line endocrine therapy for metastatic disease, patients are eligible for second-line endocrine therapy either as monotherapy or in combination with a targeted agent. The choice would depend on previous tolerance of treatment and patient preference. The NCCN Panel recommends that patients with HR-positive disease should have adequate ovarian suppressionablation and then be treated in the same way as postmenopausal patients. The NCCN Panel has outlined endocrine-based therapies that would be used in the first-line versus second- and subsequent-line settings.

The NCCN Panel has included an AI and fulvestrant as first-line therapy (category 1) for postmenopausal patients based on the above data. Monotherapy with Endocrine Agents: In postmenopausal patients there is evidence supporting the use of an AI as first-line therapy for their recurrent disease.512,513 Prospective randomized trials comparing the AI head-to-head have demonstrated that all AIs are the same.514 Tamoxifen is the commonly used selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for premenopausal patients.515 In postmenopausal patients, AI monotherapy has been shown to have superior outcome compared with tamoxifen, although the differences are modest.516-520 A randomized phase III trial comparing tamoxifen with exemestane as first-line endocrine therapy for postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer showed no significant differences in PFS or OS between the two arms.518 NCCN recommendations for first-line therapy: For postmenopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative recurrentstage IV breast cancer, NCCN category 1, preferred regimens include a cyclin-dependent kinase CDK 46 inhibitor with an AI; fulvestrant with or without a CDK 46 inhibitor; and fulvestrant with a nonsteroidal AI. The NCCN category 2A, preferred regimen includes nonsteroidal AI (ie, anastrozole, letrozole); steroidal AI (exemestane), and selective ER modulator (tamoxifen or toremifene). For premenopausal patients, first-line endocrine treatment includes ovarian suppressionablation and endocrine therapy listed above for postmenopausal patients or alternately with a SERM alone. Preferred Regimens for Second and Subsequent Lines of Therapy for HR-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer Fulvestrant-Containing Regimens Fulvestrant  CDK 46 Inhibitors: Fulvestrant in combination with a CDK 46 inhibitor may be offered to patients who experienced disease progression during prior treatment with AIs with or without one line of prior chemotherapy (category 1), because PFS was improved compared with fulvestrant alone in a phase III trial (PALOMA-3).521 The NCCN Panel notes that treatment should be limited to those without prior exposure to CDK 46 inhibitors. The PALOMA-3 compared the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant to fulvestrant in pre- or postmenopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, whose disease progressed on Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:19 AM."

One mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy is activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway. A randomized phase II study estimated the efficacy of tamoxifen alone versus tamoxifen combined with everolimus, an oral inhibitor of mTOR, in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer previously treated with an AI.530 After a median follow-up of 13 months, an intent-to-treat analysis showed that the clinical benefit was 42.1% (95% CI, 29.155.9) with tamoxifen alone and 61.1% (95% CI, 46.974.1) with tamoxifen plus everolimus. An improvement in median time to progression was seen when everolimus was combined with tamoxifen compared with tamoxifen alone. Median time to progression was 4.5 months (95% CI, 3.78.7) with tamoxifen alone versus 8.5 months (95% CI, 6.0113.9) with everolimus and tamoxifen.530 In a phase III trial in postmenopausal patients with advanced, HR-positive breast cancer with no prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease, randomized subjects to letrozole with or without the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus,531 PFS was not different between the treatment arms (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.751.05; log-rank P  .18). The results of this trial differ from that of the BOLERO-2 trial (described below). The reasons for the differences in the outcomes of these two randomized phase III studies531,532 is uncertain, but may be related to the issues of patient selection and extent of prior endocrine therapy."

The reasons for the differences in the outcomes of these two randomized phase III studies531,532 is uncertain, but may be related to the issues of patient selection and extent of prior endocrine therapy. A phase III study (BOLERO-2) randomized postmenopausal patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer that had disease progression or recurrence during treatment with a nonsteroidal AI to exemestane with or without the mTOR inhibitor everolimus.533 Final results reported after median 18-month follow-up show that median PFS (by central review) remained significantly longer with everolimus plus exemestane versus placebo plus exemestane at 11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.310.48; P  .0001).532 The adverse events (all grades) that occurred more frequently in those receiving everolimus included stomatitis, infections, rash, pneumonitis, and hyperglycemia.532,533 Analysis of safety and efficacy in the older patients enrolled in this trial showed that older patients treated with an everolimus-containing regimen had similar incidences of these adverse events, but the younger patients had more on-treatment deaths.534 Based on the evidence from the BOLERO-2 trial, the NCCN Panel has included everolimus plus exemestane as an option for patients who fulfill the entry criteria for BOLERO-2. Tamoxifen or fulvestrant in combination with everolimus have also been included as options. The NCCN Panel also notes that if there is disease progression while on an everolimus-containing regimen, there are no data to support an additional line of therapy with another everolimus regimen. Aromatase Inhibitors: AIs as monotherapy are options as subsequent-line therapy. The three AIs (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) have shown similar efficacy in the second-line setting.514,535,536 AI monotherapy maybe be useful in patients desiring single-agent treatment, if they have not received an AI as first-line treatment or if they may not be suitable for combination therapy.

Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) activating mutations are frequently detected in patients with prior exposure to AIs. All may benefit by adding one of the following to fulvestrant: a CDK 46-inhibitor, or an mTOR-inhibitor, or alpelisib, if the tumor has PIK3CA mutation. Regimens Useful in Certain Circumstances for Therapy for HR-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer Megestrol acetate,512,538-540 estradiol541 androgens such as fluoxymesterone, and single-agent abemaciclib have been listed as options useful in certain circumstances. The phase II MONARCH 1 trial evaluated the activity of abemaciclib as a single agent in patients (n  132) with refractory HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who had disease progression while on endocrine therapy and already received multiple systemic therapies (average of three prior systemic regimens).542 Ninety percent of patients had visceral disease and 50.8% had more than three sites of metastases.542 Single-agent abemaciclib induced a partial response in 26 patients (19.7%) and demonstrated an ORR of 19.7% (95% CI, 13.3 27.5).542 Median PFS was 6 months (95% CI, 4.27.5). At the final analysis, at 18 months, median OS was 22.3 months (95% CI, 17.7not reached).542 Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event reported in 90.2% of patients. Other common adverse events were fatigue (65.2%), nausea (64.4%), and decreased appetite (45.5%)."

Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia occurred in 26.9% of patients.542 The NCCN Panel has included single-agent abemaciclib as an option for those with disease progression on prior endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Systemic Therapy for Stage IV or Recurrent HR-Negative, HER2-Positive Breast Cancer For patients with HER2-positive, HR-negative recurrentstage IV breast cancer, the treatment approach is HER2-targeted therapy in combination with systemic chemotherapy. The NCCN Panel notes that an FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab. Also, trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted for trastuzumab. This subcutaneous option has different dosage and administration instructions compared to intravenous trastuzumab. Doses and schedules of representative regimens for use in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer are also included in NCCN Guidelines. Patients with disease progression while being treated with HER2-targeted therapy should be offered an additional line of treatment with a HER2-targeted therapy since it is beneficial to continue suppression of the HER2 pathway. The choice of the HER2-targeted therapy will depend on previously administered therapy, relapse-free interval, and patients preference and access. The optimal sequence of available HER2-targeted therapies and the optimal duration of HER2-targeted therapy for recurrentstage IV breast cancer is currently unknown. The NCCN Panel recommends continuing HER2-targted therapy until progressionunacceptable toxicity.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-66 Preferred Regimens for Stage IVRecurrent HER2-Positive Breast Cancer A randomized, double-blind, phase III study (CLEOPATRA) compared the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel versus trastuzumab and docetaxel as first-line treatment for 808 patients (n  808) with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.543 This trial included patients (about 10%) who had previously received trastuzumab in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. At a median follow-up of 19 months, the addition of pertuzumab to docetaxel plus trastuzumab resulted in improvement in PFS compared with placebo (median, 18.5 vs. 12.4 months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.510.75; P  .001).543 At a median follow-up of 30 months the results showed a statistically significant improvement in OS in favor of the pertuzumab-containing regimen, with a 34% reduction in the risk of death (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.520.84; P  .0008).544 The most common adverse reactions reported in the pertuzumab group compared to the control group were diarrhea (67% vs. 46%), rash (34% vs. 24%), mucosal inflammation (27% vs. 20%), febrile neutropenia (14% vs. 8%), and dry skin (10% vs. 4%). Peripheral edema and constipation were greater in the control group.543 Cardiac adverse events or left ventricular systolic dysfunction were reported slightly more frequently in the control group.545 HRQOL was not different in the two treatment groups.546 In the PERUSE study, patients (n  1436) with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer and no prior systemic therapy (except endocrine therapy) received docetaxel, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel with trastuzumab and pertuzumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The preliminary results after 52 months of median follow-up show that median PFS was comparable between docetaxel, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel (median PFS reported was 19.6, 23.0, and 18.1 months with docetaxel, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel, respectively).547 Compared with docetaxel-containing therapy, paclitaxel-containing therapy was associated with more neuropathy (31% vs. 16%), but less febrile neutropenia (1% vs. 11%) and mucositis (14% vs. 25%)."

In a phase III trial (MARIANNE), 1095 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were randomized to first-line treatment with T-DM1 with or without pertuzumab or trastuzumab plus a taxane. The PFS for T-DM1 with pertuzumab was found to be non-inferior to trastuzumab and a taxane (15.2 and 13.7 months, respectively; HR, 0.87; 97.5% CI, 0.691.08; P  .14).551 The PFS for T-DM1 alone was non-inferior to trastuzumab plus a taxane (14.1 and 13.7, respectively; HR, 0.91; 97.5% CI, 0.731.13; P  .31).551 The incidence of grade 35 adverse events was 54.1%, 45.4%, and 46.2% in the trastuzumab plus a taxane arm, T-DM1 arm, and T-DM1 plus pertuzumab arm, respectively.

Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and a taxane, however, remains the preferred first-line regimen for HER2-positive metastatic disease based on data demonstrating improved OS compared to trastuzumab and a taxane. TDM-1 as first-line therapy should be considered only in those not suitable for the preferred treatment. First-line trastuzumab in combination with selected chemotherapy552 are additional options for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Randomized trials demonstrate benefit from adding trastuzumab to other agents including paclitaxel with or without carboplatin,552-555 docetaxel,553 and vinorelbine,553 for patients with HER2-positive metastatic disease. In addition, the combination of trastuzumab and capecitabine has also shown efficacy as a first-line trastuzumab-containing regimen in this setting.556,557 The NCCN Panel believes the 27% frequency of significant cardiac dysfunction in patients treated with the combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicincyclophosphamide chemotherapy in the metastatic setting is too high for use of this combination outside the confines of a prospective clinical trial.552,557,558 In those with disease progression on first-line trastuzumab-containing regimens, the NCCN Panel recommends continuation of HER2 blockade. This recommendation also applies to patients who are diagnosed with HER2-positive metastatic disease after prior exposure to trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting."

This recommendation also applies to patients who are diagnosed with HER2-positive metastatic disease after prior exposure to trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting. Several trials have demonstrated benefit of continuation of trastuzumab therapy following disease progression on a trastuzumab-containing regimen.559-561 However, the optimal duration of trastuzumab in patients with long-term control of disease is unknown. The results of a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II study (n  66) show that the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab is active and well tolerated in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has progressed on prior trastuzumab therapy.562 The trial reported an ORR of 24.2% (16 patients out of 66). The median PFS time observed with pertuzumab and trastuzumab combination was 15.5 months (range, 0.917.0 months; 80% CI, 1831 months).562 The reported median duration of response with the combination was 5.8 months (range, 2.915.3 months).562 To determine whether the clinical benefit seen in the study was from pertuzumab alone or was a result of the combined effect of pertuzumab and trastuzumab, a cohort of patients (n  29) whose disease progressed during prior trastuzumab-based therapy received pertuzumab monotherapy until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Of these, patients with disease progression (n  17) continued to receive pertuzumab with the addition of trastuzumab. In the 29 patients who received pertuzumab monotherapy, the ORR and clinical benefit rate reported were 3.4% and 10.3%, respectively, whereas in the patients who received dual blockade after disease progression while on pertuzumab, the ORR and clinical benefit rate were 17.6% and 41.2%, respectively.563 According to the NCCN Panel, for patients with disease progression after treatment with trastuzumab-based therapy without pertuzumab, a line of therapy containing both trastuzumab plus pertuzumab with or without a cytotoxic agent (such as vinorelbine or taxane) may be considered. Further research is needed to determine the ideal sequencing strategy for HER2-targeted therapy."

Lapatinib in combination with capecitabine or trastuzumab are options for patients with HER2-positive disease following disease progression on a trastuzumab-containing regimen. A phase III study compared lapatinib plus capecitabine with capecitabine alone in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer refractory to trastuzumab in the metastatic setting and with prior treatment with an anthracycline and a taxane in either the metastatic or adjuvant setting.566 Time to progression was increased in the group receiving combination therapy when compared with the group receiving capecitabine monotherapy (8.4 months vs. 4.4 months; HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.340.71; P  .001).

About a third of all patients had received prior treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1. The ORR (32.8% vs. 26.7%; P  .1201), clinical benefit rate (44.5% vs. 35.6%; P  .0328), and median duration of response (8.5 vs. 5.6 months) all favored the neratinib arm.

Systemic Therapy for Recurrent or Stage IV HR-Positive, HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Patients with stage IV or recurrent disease characterized by tumors that are HR-positive, HER2-positive tumors have the option of receiving HER2-directed therapy as a component of their treatment plan. Options include treatment with a HER2-targeted therapy plus chemotherapy or endocrine therapy alone or in combination with HER2-targeted therapy. Endocrine therapy alone or in combination with HER2-targeted therapy is a less toxic approach compared with HER2-targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy.

The median OS with olaparib compared with treatment of physicians choice was 19.3 months versus 17.1 months, respectively (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.661.23; P  .513).580 The QOL was significantly better in the olaparib arm. It is interesting to note that patients who had not received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting achieved a 7.9-month longer median OS with olaparib compared with treatment of physicians choice.580 The phase III EMBRACA trial of patients with advanced breast cancer harboring the germline BRCA mutations and no prior exposure to a PARP inhibitor, were randomized to talazoparib (n  287) or to physicians choice of single-agent chemotherapy (n  144).581 The median PFS among patients in the talazoparib group was longer than in the control group (8.6 months 95% CI, 7.29.3 vs. 5.6 months 95% CI, 4.26.7; HR for disease progression or death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.410.71; P  .001).581 Based on the results of the above phase III trials, the two FDA-approved PARP inhibitors, olaparib and talazoparib, are included as category 1, preferred options for those with germline BRCA12 mutations. The NCCN Panel recommends assessing for germline BRCA12 mutations in all patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer to identify candidates for PARP inhibitor therapy. While olaparib and talazoparib are FDA- indicated in HER2-negative disease, the NCCN Panel supports use in any breast cancer subtype associated with germline BRCA12 mutations. Platinums: The phase III TNT trial compared docetaxel with carboplatin in the first-line setting in patients (n  376) with triple-negative breast cancer. In the unselected population, carboplatin was not more active than docetaxel (ORR, 31.4% vs. 34.0%; P  .66). 582 Patients with a germline BRCA12 mutation had a significantly better response to carboplatin than docetaxel (ORR, 68.0% vs. 33.3%, absolute difference, 34.7%; P  .03). 582 PFS was also improved with carboplatin treatment in patients with a germline BRCA12 mutation (median PFS, 6.8 months vs. 4.4 months); no difference was found in OS. However, patients with somatic BRCA12 mutation in the tumor DNA did not appear to have the same advantage. For those with triple-negative recurrentstage IV breast cancer and germline BRCA12 mutations, the NCCN Panel has included platinum agents (cisplatin and carboplatin) as preferred treatment options."

Systemic Chemotherapy for Recurrent or Stage IV Disease Patients with HR-negative tumors not localized to the bone or soft tissue only, or that are associated with symptomatic visceral metastasis irrespective of HR- or HER-status, or that have HR-positive tumors that are refractory to endocrine therapy should receive systemic chemotherapy. A variety of chemotherapy regimens are felt to be appropriate, as outlined in the treatment algorithm. Combination chemotherapy generally provides higher rates of objective response and longer time to progression, in comparison to single-agent chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy is, however, associated with an increase in toxicity and is of little survival benefit.586-590 Furthermore, administering single agents sequentially decreases the likelihood that dose reductions will be needed. Thus, the NCCN Panel finds no compelling evidence that combination chemotherapy is superior to sequential single agents. Therefore, sequential monotherapy is preferred and combination therapy is useful in patients with rapid clinical progression or need for rapid symptom andor disease control. Usually the first-line regimens are given until progression or unacceptable toxicity."

Therefore, sequential monotherapy is preferred and combination therapy is useful in patients with rapid clinical progression or need for rapid symptom andor disease control. Usually the first-line regimens are given until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Considering what is unacceptable toxicity and considering no further cytotoxic therapy should be decided together with the patient. Adverse effects may require dose reduction and cessation of chemotherapy prior to disease progression. The NCCN Panel recommends considering scalp cooling to reduce incidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia for patients receiving chemotherapy. The data on efficacy of scalp cooling is mainly from the adjuvant setting and also show that results may be less effective with anthracycline-containing regimens.591-595 A meta-analysis showed favorable impact on OS by prolonging treatment until disease progression.596 In this analysis, data from four studies involving 666 patients indicated that median OS was increased by 23% (95% CI, 938%; P  .01) in patients receiving longer durations of chemotherapy versus a limited number of cycles.596 In a systematic review, longer durations of chemotherapy demonstrated a marginal increase in OS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.840.99) and a significant improvement in PFS (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.60.72), compared with shorter durations.590 Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:19 AM.

Most patients will be candidates for multiple lines of systemic therapy for palliation. At each reassessment clinicians should assess the value of ongoing treatment, the risks and benefits of an additional line of systemic therapy, patient performance status, and patient preferences through a shared decision-making process. Preferred Chemotherapy Regimens for Stage IV or Recurrent Metastatic Disease The NCCN Panel has classified the chemotherapy agents into three categories: preferred, other recommended, and useful in certain circumstances. The treatment decision should be individualized and consider previous therapies, pre-existing comorbidities, nature of the disease, toxicity profiles, patient preferences, and in some cases access to agents. Among preferred single agents, the NCCN Panel has included taxanes (paclitaxel), anthracyclines (doxorubicin and liposomal doxorubicin), antimetabolites (capecitabine and gemcitabine), microtubule inhibitors (eribulin and vinorelbine), and platinum agents for patients with triple- negative tumors and germline BRCA12 mutations. Paclitaxel can be administered weekly (80 mgm2)598 or every 3 weeks (175 mgm2).599 A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared weekly and every-3-week taxane regimens in advanced breast cancer showed that compared with every-3-week treatment, weekly administration of paclitaxel resulted in an improvement in OS (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.670.89).600 Doxorubicin (6075 mgm2) every 3 weeks, or 20 mgm2 weekly has shown an ORR between 30% to 47%.601-604 Liposomal doxorubicin (50 mgm2 every 4 weeks) has been shown to have efficacy similar to doxorubicin (60 mgm2 every 3 weeks).605 It has also been shown to have efficacy in the second-line setting for patients with metastatic breast cancer.605 Compared with doxorubicin, liposomal doxorubicin has a less frequent dosing schedule, decreased risk of cardiotoxicity (7% vs. 26%; HR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.586.31), decreased rate of nausea (37% vs. 53%) and vomiting (19% vs. 31%), lower rates of alopecia (20% vs. 66%), and lower rates of neutropenia (4% vs. 10%).605 However, compared with doxorubicin it was associated with a higher rate of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (48% vs. 2%), stomatitis (22% vs. 15%), and mucositis (23% vs. 13%).605 The benefit of capecitabine as a treatment option for patients with metastatic breast cancer has been demonstrated in multiple phase II trials."

The median OS was also longer with albumin-bound paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus albumin-bound paclitaxelgemcitabine (16.8 vs. 12.1 months; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.47 1.13; P  .16) or gemcitabinecarboplatin (16.8 vs. 12.6 months; HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.521.22; P  .29). The ORR was 73%, 39%, and 44%, respectively.630 A series of trials have sought to define the role of bevacizumab in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The E2100 trial randomized 722 patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer to first-line chemotherapy with paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab.633 This trial documented superior PFS (11.8 months vs. 5.9 months; HR, 0.60; P .001) favoring bevacizumab plus paclitaxel compared with paclitaxel alone. A similar trial enrolled 736 patients who were randomized to treatment with docetaxel and bevacizumab or docetaxel and placebo.637 This trial also documented increased PFS in the arm containing bevacizumab (10.1 months vs. 8.2 months with docetaxel alone; HR, 0.77; P  .006). An additional trial, RIBBON-1, combined bevacizumab with capecitabine, with a taxane (docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel), with anthracyclines (FEC, CAF, AC, or EC), or with the same chemotherapy alone."

If substituted for weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, then the weekly dose of nab-paclitaxel should not exceed 125 mgm2. The data from the above-mentioned randomized trials document that the addition of bevacizumab to first- or second-line chemotherapy agents modestly improves time to progression and response rates. The time-to-progression impact may vary among cytotoxic agents and appears greatest with bevacizumab in combination with weekly paclitaxel. None of these studies demonstrate an increase in OS or QOL when analyzed alone or in a meta-analyses of the trials.639 Therefore, the NCCN Panel has included bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel as an option useful in only select circumstances. This regimen was compared in the first-line setting with capecitabine monotherapy, and results show similar ORR and PFS.626 However, CMF Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:19 AM.

Larotrectinib641-643 and entrectinib643,644 are two NTRK inhibitors that are FDA-approved for the treatment of solid tumors that have an NTRK gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation and have no satisfactory alternative treatments or that have progressed following treatment. If a patient with recurrentstage IV breast cancer presents with a tumor with an NTRK fusion, treatment with an NTRK inhibitor is an option if no satisfactory alternative treatments exist or for disease progression following treatment. Pembrolizumab is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.645-647 Pembrolizumab has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer and high tumor mutational burden (9 mutationsmegabase) determined by commercially available tests.648 If a patient with recurrentstage IV breast cancer presents with a tumor with MSI-Hmismatch repair (MMR) mutation, whose disease has progressed following prior treatments and no satisfactory alternative treatment options, treatment pembrolizumab is an option. Monitoring Metastatic Disease Monitoring the treatment of metastatic breast cancer involves a wide array of assessments and the need for the clinician to integrate several different forms of information to decide on the effectiveness of treatment and the acceptability of toxicity. The information includes those from direct observations of the patient, including patient-reported symptoms, performance status, change in weight, and physical examination; laboratory tests such as alkaline phosphatase, liver function, blood counts, and calcium; radiographic imaging; functional imaging; and, where appropriate, tumor biomarkers. The results of these evaluations generally are classified as response, continued response to treatment, stable disease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease."

The results of these evaluations generally are classified as response, continued response to treatment, stable disease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease. The clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different forms of information to decide, along with the patient, whether disease is being controlled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable. Sometimes individual pieces of information can be conflicting with regard to disease response, and clinical judgment along with patient input is critical. The NCCN Panel recommends using widely accepted criteria for reporting response, stability, and progression of disease such as the RECIST criteria649 and the WHO criteria.650 The Panel also recommends using the same method of response assessment over time. For example, an abnormality initially found on diagnostic CT scan of the chest should be monitored with repeat diagnostic CT scans of the chest. The optimal frequency of testing is uncertain and primarily based on the monitoring strategies utilized in breast cancer clinical trials. The page titled Principles of Monitoring Metastatic Disease in the algorithm provides a table outlining general recommendations for the frequency and type of monitoring as a baseline before initiation of a new therapy, for monitoring the effectiveness of cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, and as an assessment when there is evidence of disease progression. NCCN Guidelines and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-77 Panel has indicated in a footnote that the frequency of monitoring can be reduced in patients who have long-term stable disease. These are guidelines and should be modified for the individual patient using clinical judgment, especially for those with stable or responding disease for long periods of time. The clinical use of circulating tumor cells (CTC) or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in metastatic breast cancer is not yet included in the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer for disease assessment and monitoring. Patients with persistently increased CTC after 3 weeks of first-line chemotherapy have a poor PFS and OS.651 In spite of its prognostic ability, CTC count has failed to show a predictive value."

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-78 Special Situations Paget Disease Paget disease of the breast is a rare manifestation of breast cancer characterized by neoplastic cells in the epidermis of the NAC.652 It most commonly presents with eczema of the areola, bleeding, ulceration, and itching of the nipple. The diagnosis is often delayed because of the rare nature of the condition and confusion with other dermatologic conditions. There is an associated cancer elsewhere in the breast in up to about 80% to 90% of cases.653-655 The associated cancers are not necessarily located adjacent to the NAC and may be either DCIS or invasive cancer. Patients with clinical signs that raise suspicion for Paget disease require a complete history and physical examination and diagnostic breast imaging. Any breast lesion identified by imaging or examination should be evaluated according to the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis. The skin of the NAC should undergo surgical biopsy, including the full thickness of the epidermis including at least a portion of any clinically involved NAC. When biopsy of the NAC is positive for Paget disease, breast MRI is recommended to define the extent of disease and identify additional disease.655,656 There are no category 1 data that specifically address local management of Paget disease. Systemic therapy is based on the stage and biological characteristics of any underlying cancer, and is supported by the evidence cited in the relevant stage-specific breast cancer treatment guidelines. Management of Paget disease has traditionally been total mastectomy with axillary dissection."

Systemic therapy is based on the stage and biological characteristics of any underlying cancer, and is supported by the evidence cited in the relevant stage-specific breast cancer treatment guidelines. Management of Paget disease has traditionally been total mastectomy with axillary dissection. Total mastectomy remains a reasonable option for patients regardless of the absence or presence of an associated breast cancer.654 Data demonstrate that satisfactory local control may be achieved with BCS including the excision with negative margins of any underlying breast cancer along with resection of the NAC followed by WBRT.657-661 The risk of ipsilateral breast recurrence after breast-conserving NAC resection and RT with or without an associated cancer is similar to that with BCS and RT with the typical invasive or in situ cancer. For Paget disease without an associated cancer (ie, no palpable mass or imaging abnormality), it is recommended that BCS consist of removal of the entire NAC with a negative margin of underlying breast tissue. In cases with an associated cancer elsewhere in the breast, the surgery includes removal of the NAC with a negative margin and removal of the peripheral cancer using standard breast-conserving technique to achieve a negative margin. It is not necessary to remove the NAC and the peripheral cancer in continuity in a single surgical specimen or through a single incision. ALN staging is not necessary when breast-conserving therapy is used to treat Paget disease with underlying DCIS without evidence of invasive cancer following clinical examination, imaging evaluation, and full-thickness skin biopsy of the involved NAC. In the presence of an underlying invasive breast cancer treated with BCS, axillary surgery should be performed according to the Considerations for Surgical Axillary Staging outlined in the NCCN Guidelines algorithm. In cases treated by total mastectomy, axillary staging is recommended for patients with invasive disease and should also be considered for patients with underlying DCIS without evidence of invasive disease. This is because the final pathology may reveal an invasive cancer in the mastectomy specimen and the mastectomy precludes subsequent sentinel node biopsy. Two retrospective studies have provided evidence for a high degree of accuracy in the identification of the sentinel node(s) in patients with Paget disease.662,663 Patients treated with breast conservation should receive whole breast radiation."

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-80 Phyllodes Tumors of the Breast (also known as phyllodes tumors, cystosarcoma phyllodes) Phyllodes tumors of the breast are rare tumors comprised of both stromal and epithelial elements.664 Phyllodes tumors exist in benign, borderline, and malignant subtypes, although there is not uniform agreement on the criteria for assigning subtype or for predicting biological behavior.665 The subtype of phyllodes tumor appears less important for risk of recurrence than does the margin of tumor-free resection achieved by surgical treatment. Phyllodes tumors occur in an older age distribution than fibroadenoma, a younger age distribution than the invasive ductal and lobular cancers, and with a mean age of 40 years.666 Phyllodes tumors often enlarge rapidly and are usually painless. Phyllodes tumors often appear on ultrasound and mammography as fibroadenomas, and FNA cytology and even core needle biopsy are inadequate to reliably distinguish phyllodes tumors from fibroadenomas.666 Thus, in the setting of a large or rapidly enlarging clinical fibroadenoma, excisional biopsy should be considered to pathologically exclude a phyllodes tumor."

Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (germline TP53 mutation, see NCCN Guidelines for GeneticFamilial High Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic) have an increased risk for phyllodes tumors.667 Local recurrences of phyllodes tumors are the most common site of recurrence. Most distant recurrences occur in the lung, and may be solid nodules or thin-walled cavities. Treatment of phyllodes tumors (which includes benign, borderline, and malignant subtypes) is with local surgical excision with tumor-free margins of 1 cm. Total mastectomy is necessary only if negative margins cannot be obtained by lumpectomy or partial mastectomy.668 Since phyllodes tumors rarely metastasize to the ALNs, surgical axillary staging or ALND is not necessary unless the lymph nodes are pathologic on clinical examination.669 In those patients who experience a local recurrence, resection of the recurrence with wide, tumor-free surgical margins should be performed. Some Panel members recommend local RT of the remaining breast or chest wall following resection of a local recurrence, but this recommendation is controversial (category 2B).670 While the epithelial component of most phyllodes tumors contains ER (58%) andor PR (75%),671 endocrine therapy has no proven role in the treatment of phyllodes tumors. Similarly, there is no evidence that adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy provides benefit in reduction of recurrences or death. In the rare patient who experiences a systemic recurrence (usually in the lung), treatment should be as recommended in the NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-81 Breast Cancer During Pregnancy Breast cancer occurring concurrently with pregnancy is an infrequent clinical event. In a California registry study, there were 1.3 breast cancers diagnosed per 10,000 live births.672 Unfortunately, breast cancer during pregnancy is most often ALN-positive and with larger primary tumor size. Histologically the tumors are poorly differentiated, are more frequently ERPR-negative, and approximately 30% are HER2-positive.673,674 The diagnosis is often delayed because neither the patient nor the physician suspects malignancy. Evaluation of the pregnant patient with suspected breast cancer should include a physical examination with particular attention to the breast and regional lymph nodes. Mammogram of the breast with shielding can be done safely and the accuracy is reported to be 80%.675 Ultrasound of the breast and regional lymph nodes can be used to assess the extent of disease and also to guide biopsy. Ultrasound has been reported to be abnormal in up to 100% of breast cancers occurring during pregnancy.675 Biopsies for cytologic evaluation of a suspicious breast mass may be done with FNA of the breast and suspicious lymph nodes. This provides tissue for histologic confirmation of invasive disease as well as adequate tissue for HR and HER2 analyses. Staging assessment of the pregnant patient with breast cancer may be guided by clinical disease stage. For clinically node-negative T1T2 tumors, a chest x-ray (with shielding), liver function and renal function assessment, and a CBC with differential are appropriate. In patients who have clinically node-positive or T3 breast lesions, in addition to the aforementioned tests an ultrasound of the liver and consideration of a screening MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine without contrast may be employed. The documentation of the presence of metastases may alter the treatment plan and influence the patients decision regarding maintenance of the pregnancy. Assessment of the pregnancy should include a maternal fetal medicine consultation and review of antecedent maternal risks such as hypertension, diabetes, and complications with prior pregnancies. Documentation of fetal growth and development and fetal age by means of ultrasonographic assessment is appropriate. Estimation of the date of the delivery will help with systemic chemotherapy planning. In addition, maternal fetal medicine consultation should include counseling regarding maintaining or terminating pregnancy."

Counseling of the pregnant patient with breast cancer should include a review of the treatment options, which include mastectomy or BCS as well as the use of systemic therapy. However, BCS is possible if RT can be delayed to the postpartum period,676 and breast-conserving therapy during pregnancy does not appear to have a negative impact on survival.676,677 When surgery is performed at 25 weeks of gestation or later, obstetrical and prenatal specialists must be onsite and immediately available in the event of precipitous delivery of a viable fetus. Although there are a limited number of isolated case reports and small retrospective studies evaluating use of SLNB in pregnant patients,678,679 the sensitivity and specificity of the procedure have not been established in this setting. Thus, there are insufficient data on which to base recommendations for its use in pregnant patients. A review of the relative and absolute contraindications to sentinel node biopsy concluded that sentinel node biopsy should not be offered to pregnant patients 30 weeks gestation.680 There are limited data with only case reports and estimations of fetal radiation dose regarding use of radioactive tracer (eg, technetium 99m sulfur colloid).681-683 Isosulfan blue or methylene blue dye for sentinel node biopsy procedures is discouraged during pregnancy.

If systemic therapy is initiated, fetal monitoring prior to each chemotherapy cycle is appropriate. Chemotherapy during pregnancy should not be given after week 35 of pregnancy or within 3 weeks of planned delivery in order to avoid the potential for hematologic complications during delivery. Data from a single-institution prospective study indicate that FAC chemotherapy (5-fluorouraci 500 mgm2 IV days 1 and 4, doxorubicin 50 mgm2 by IV infusion over 72 hours, and cyclophosphamide 500 mgm2 IV day 1) may be given with relative safety during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.685 As reported by Gwyn et al, the median gestational age at delivery was 38 weeks, more than 50% of the patients had a vaginal delivery, and there were no fetal deaths.673 An update of this experience reported on 57 patients treated with FAC in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. There was one child with Down syndrome and two with congenital abnormalities (club foot, congenital bilateral ureteral reflux). The children are reported to be healthy and progressing well in school.685,688 Ondansetron, lorazepam, and dexamethasone can be used as part of the pre-chemotherapy antiemetic regimen. There are limited data on the use of taxanes during pregnancy.689-692 If used, the NCCN Panel recommends weekly administration of paclitaxel after the first trimester if clinically indicated by disease status. There are only case reports of trastuzumab use during pregnancy.693-700 The majority of these case reports indicated oligohydramnios or anhydramnios with administration of trastuzumab; fetal renal failure occurred in one case. If trastuzumab is otherwise indicated, it should be administered in the postpartum period; the Panel recommends against its use during pregnancy. A single case report of first-trimester exposure to lapatinib during treatment for breast cancer reported an uncomplicated delivery of a healthy female neonate.701 Endocrine therapy and RT are contraindicated during pregnancy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-83 Inflammatory Breast Cancer IBC is a rare, aggressive form of breast cancer estimated to account for 1% to 6% of breast cancer cases in the United States.702,703 IBC is a clinical diagnosis that requires erythema and dermal edema (peau dorange) of a third or more of the skin of the breast. IBC is usually HR-negative and is more frequently HER2-positive than the usual ductal breast cancers. Studies on gene expression profiling of IBC have demonstrated that all the subtypes of IBC exist, but basal and HER2 overexpressed are more frequent.704-707 According to the 7th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, IBC is classified as stage IIIB, stage IIIC, or stage IV breast cancer, depending on the degree of nodal involvement and whether distant metastases are present. The primary tumor of IBC is classified as T4d by definition, even when no mass is specifically apparent in the breast. On radiographic imaging, findings of skin thickening and, in some cases, an underlying mass are observed. Despite use of the term inflammatory, the characteristic clinical features of IBC are due to blockage of dermal lymphatics by tumor emboli. Although a biopsy is required to evaluate for the presence of cancer in breast tissue and the dermal lymphatics, a diagnosis of IBC is based on clinical findings, and dermal lymphatic involvement is neither required, nor sufficient by itself, to assign a diagnosis of IBC.708,709 The differential diagnosis includes cellulitis of the breast and mastitis. In the past, IBC has often been placed under the general heading of locally advanced breast cancer."

In the past, IBC has often been placed under the general heading of locally advanced breast cancer. There is a growing body of evidence that patients with IBC, when compared with patients with noninflammatory forms of locally advanced breast cancer, are more likely to have a less favorable prognosis710-712 and to be younger at the time of disease presentation.713 The NCCN Panel acknowledges that studies focusing on genetic characterization of IBC are needed to more clearly define IBC as a disease entity and to optimize treatment.714,715 Nevertheless, current evidence provides justification for a separate guideline for the workup and treatment of patients diagnosed with IBC. StageT4d, N0N3, M0 Workup Patients with a clinicalpathologic diagnosis of IBC without distant metastasis (stage T4d, N0N3, M0) should undergo a thorough staging evaluation by a multidisciplinary team. Recommendations for workup include a complete history and physical examination involving a CBC and platelet count. A pathology review and pre-chemotherapy determinations of tumor HR- and HER2- status should be performed. HER2 has a predictive role in determining which patients with IBC will benefit from HER2-targeted therapy. The NCCN Panel endorses the CAP protocol for pathology reporting ( and endorses the ASCO CAP recommendations for quality control performance of HER2 testing and interpretation of IHC and ISH results.716 Imaging studies help facilitate image-guided biopsy, delineate locoregional disease, and identify distant metastases. Evaluation of all patients suspected with IBC must include diagnostic bilateral mammogram, with the addition of ultrasound as necessary. Evaluations for the presence of distant metastasis in the asymptomatic patient include LFTs, bone scan or sodium fluoride PETCT (category 2B), and diagnostic CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (category 2B; category 2A for diagnostic CT imaging of the chest when pulmonary symptoms are present).

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-84 FDG-PETCT may be most helpful in situations where standard imaging results are equivocal or suspicious. However, there is limited evidence suggesting that PETCT may be a useful adjunct to standard imaging of IBC due to the increased risk of regional lymph node involvement and distant spread of disease in this group of patients.110,111,717,718 Nevertheless, equivocal or suspicious sites identified by FDG-PETCT scanning or other imaging methods should be biopsied for confirmation of stage IV disease whenever possible. The consensus of the Panel is that FDG-PETCT can be performed at the same time as diagnostic CT. If FDG-PET and diagnostic CT are performed and both clearly indicate bone metastases, bone scan or sodium fluoride PETCT may not be needed. Genetic counseling is recommended if the patient is considered to be at high risk for hereditary breast cancer as defined by the NCCN Guidelines for GeneticFamilial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian and Pancreatic. Treatment The treatment of patients with IBC should involve a combined modality approach702 comprising preoperative systemic therapy followed by surgery (mastectomy) and radiotherapy. Preoperative Chemotherapy There are no large randomized trials evaluating the optimal systemic treatment of IBC, since it is a rare disease. The systemic therapy recommendations are based on data from retrospective analyses, small prospective studies, and data from non-IBC, locally advanced breast cancer."

The systemic therapy recommendations are based on data from retrospective analyses, small prospective studies, and data from non-IBC, locally advanced breast cancer. The benefit of preoperative systemic therapy followed by mastectomy over preoperative systemic therapy alone in patients with IBC was shown in a retrospective analysis in which lower local recurrence rates and longer disease-specific survival were reported for the combined modality approach.719 Results from a large retrospective study of patients with IBC performed over a 20-year period at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center demonstrated that initial treatment with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy followed by local therapy (ie, RT or mastectomy, or both) and additional postoperative chemotherapy resulted in a 15-year DFS rate of 28%.720 A retrospective study demonstrated that the addition of a taxane to an anthracycline-based regimen improved PFS and OS in patients with ER-negative IBC.721 A systematic review found evidence for an association between the intensity of preoperative therapy and the likelihood of a pCR.722 A study of IBC patients, with cytologically confirmed ALN metastases, treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without a taxane indicated that more patients receiving the anthracycline-taxane combination achieved a pCR compared with those who received only anthracycline-based therapy. In addition, patients who had a pCR in the ALNs had superior OS and DFS compared with those with residual axillary disease.723 The NCCN Panel recommends preoperative systemic therapy with an anthracycline-based regimen with or without taxanes for the initial treatment of patients with IBC. The Panel also recommends completing the planned chemotherapy prior to mastectomy. If the chemotherapy was not completed preoperatively, it should be completed postoperatively.

NCCN Guidelines and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-85 systemic chemotherapy is associated with better response rates.414,725-728 A prospective study that randomized patients with locally advanced breast cancers, including those with IBC, to neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab for 1 year demonstrated that the addition of trastuzumab significantly improved the response rate and event-free survival.414 The NCCN Panel recommends inclusion of trastuzumab in the chemotherapy regimen and is recommended for patients with HER2-positive disease. There are no available data to indicate the optimal duration of trastuzumab, specifically among patients with IBC. However, based on the available data,414 the Panel recommends continuing trastuzumab therapy for up to 1 year. Results of small phase II trials indicate that other HER2-targeting agents such as lapatinib and pertuzumab have a clinical benefit in IBC.729,730 The results of the NEOSPHERE trial that included patients with IBC showed increased pCR with the pertuzumab-containing regimens. Therefore, the NCCN Panel has included in a footnote that a pertuzumab-containing regimen may be administered preoperatively in patients with HER2-positive IBC.730 Determination of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in IBC should include a combination of physical examination and radiologic assessment. Surgery Patients with a clinicalpathologic diagnosis of IBC should always be treated with chemotherapy before surgery. It has been known for many years that surgical treatment as primary treatment of patients with IBC is associated with poor outcomes.731 SLN dissection is not a reliable method of assessing ALNs among patients with IBC.732 Use of BCS in patients with IBC has been associated with poor cosmesis, and limited data suggest that rates of local recurrence may be higher when compared with mastectomy. Mastectomy with level III ALND is the recommended surgical procedure recommended by the NCCN Panel for patients whose tumor responds to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The NCCN Panel has listed delayed breast reconstruction as an option that can be recommended to patients with IBC who have undergone a modified radical mastectomy."

Mastectomy with level III ALND is the recommended surgical procedure recommended by the NCCN Panel for patients whose tumor responds to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The NCCN Panel has listed delayed breast reconstruction as an option that can be recommended to patients with IBC who have undergone a modified radical mastectomy. Reconstruction of the breasts soon after mastectomy may compromise the post-mastectomy RT outcomes.733 For patients with IBC who do not respond to preoperative systemic therapy, mastectomy is not generally recommended. Additional systemic chemotherapy andor preoperative radiation should be considered for these patients. Patients with tumors responding to this secondary therapy should undergo mastectomy and subsequent treatment as described above. Radiation After mastectomy, RT is recommended after the completion of the planned chemotherapy. The probability of locoregional lymph node involvement is high for patients with IBC. To reduce the risk of local recurrence, the Panel recommends RT to the chest wall and the supraclavicular region. If the internal mammary lymph node(s) is clinically or pathologically involved, RT should include the internal mammary nodes. If the internal mammary nodes are not clinically or pathologically involved, then including the internal mammary nodes in the RT field is at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist (category 3). For HER2-positive disease, trastuzumab may be administered concomitantly with RT.

Evidence to support recommendations for patients presenting with axillary breast cancer comes from a limited number of retrospective studies involving small numbers of patients734-736 (see also references therein). Although treatment of patients with axillary metastases from an unknown primary tumor has typically involved mastectomy and axillary nodal dissection, some of these patients have also been successfully treated with axillary nodal dissection followed by RT.735,736 Patients with a suspected occult primary breast cancer will typically present to the oncologist after undergoing an initial biopsy: core needle biopsy (preferred), andor FNA. Therefore, the pathologist must be consulted to determine whether the available biopsy material is adequate, or if additional biopsy material is necessary (eg, core needle, incisional, or excisional biopsy) to provide an accurate and complete diagnosis. Workup for Possible Primary Breast Cancer MRI of the breast can facilitate the identification of occult breast cancer, and can help select those patients most likely to benefit from mastectomy.737 For example, in a study of 40 patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer in the axilla, and a negative or indeterminate mammogram, MRI identified the primary breast lesion in 70% of the patients.735 In addition, of the 7 patients with a negative MRI who subsequently underwent ALND and RT to the whole breast, no evidence of local recurrence was evident at a median follow-up of 19 months. The NCCN Guidelines for Occult Primary provide guidance on the diagnosis and initial workup of patients with a suspicious axillary mass without any signs of a primary tumor. A small subset of these patients may have a primary cancer in the axillary tail of the breast. Adenocarcinoma with positive axillary nodes and mediastinal nodes is highly suggestive of a breast primary. Adenocarcinoma in the supraclavicular nodes, chest, peritoneum, retroperitoneum, liver, bone, or brain could also indicate primary breast cancer in patients. The guidelines suggest the use of a mammogram and breast ultrasound for such patients. Elevated ERPR levels provide strong evidence for a breast cancer diagnosis.738 MRI of the breast should be considered for a patient with histopathologic evidence of breast cancer when mammography and ultrasound are not adequate to assess the extent of the disease."

MRI may be especially helpful in patients with dense breast tissue, positive axillary nodes, and suspected occult primary breast tumor or to evaluate the chest wall.739 Breast MRI has been shown to be useful in identifying the primary site in patients with occult primary breast cancer and may also facilitate breast conservation in selected patients by allowing for lumpectomy instead of mastectomy.735,740 In one report, the primary site was identified using MRI in about half of the patients presenting with axillary metastases, irrespective of the breast density.741 The NCCN Guidelines for Occult Primary also provide recommendations for additional workup, including chest and abdominal CT to evaluate for evidence of distant metastases for patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma (or carcinoma not otherwise specified) of the axillary nodes without evidence of a primary breast lesion.

NCCN Guidelines Version 6.2024 Breast Cancer MS-87 Treatment for Possible Primary Breast Cancer Patients with MRI-positive breast disease should undergo evaluation with ultrasound or MRI-guided biopsy and receive treatment according to the clinical stage of the breast cancer. Treatment recommendations for those with MRI-negative disease are based on nodal status. For patients with T0, N1, M0 disease, options include mastectomy plus axillary nodal dissection or axillary nodal dissection plus whole breast irradiation with or without nodal irradiation. Systemic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or trastuzumab is given according to the recommendations for stage II or III disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, trastuzumab, and endocrine therapy should be considered for patients with T0, N2N3, M0 disease followed by axillary nodal dissection and mastectomy as for patients with locally advanced disease.
