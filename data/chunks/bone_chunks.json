Preoperative biopsy consultation with a pediatric oncologist as appropriate is recommended for children.  Biopsy diagnosis is necessary prior to any surgical procedure or fixation of primary site.  Biopsy is optimally performed at a center that will do definitive management.  Placement of biopsy is critical.  Biopsy should be core needle or surgical biopsy.  Technique: Apply same principles for core needle or open biopsy. Needle biopsy is not recommended for skull base tumors.  Appropriate communication between the surgeon, musculoskeletal or interventional radiologist, and bone pathologist is critical.  Fresh tissue may be needed for molecular studies and tissue banking.  In general, not following appropriate biopsy procedures may lead to adverse patient outcomes. Surgery  Wide excision should achieve histologically negative surgical margins.  Negative surgical margins optimize local tumor control.  Local tumor control may be achieved by either limb-sparing excision or limb amputation (individualized for a given patient).  Limb-sparing excision is preferred to optimize function if reasonable functional expectations can be achieved.  Final pathologic evaluation should include assessment of surgical margins, sizedimensions of tumor, and response to preoperative therapy.  Fresh tissue may be needed for molecular studies and tissue banking. Laboratory Studies  Laboratory studies such as CBC, LDH, and ALP may have relevance in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients with bone sarcoma and should be done prior to definitive treatment and periodically during treatment and surveillance.  Consider molecular studies to delineate potential therapeutic options. Treatment  Fertility issues should be addressed with patients prior to commencing chemotherapy.  See NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology.  Select patients with osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma may benefit from a referral for genetic consultation and testing based on family history with a genetic predisposition for bone sarcomas.  Care for patients with bone cancer should be delivered directly by physicians on the multidisciplinary team (category 1). Long-Term Follow-up and SurveillanceSurvivorship  Patients should have a survivorship prescription to schedule follow-up with a multidisciplinary team.  Life-long follow-up is recommended for surveillance and treatment of late effects of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy in long-term survivors.  See NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship."

Microscopic examination is the gold standard for diagnosis of bone tumors, which should be performed in conjunction with review of radiologic studies. Ancillary techniques should be applied to support the diagnosis of selected sarcoma types, such as Ewing sarcoma (eg, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH, andor molecular genetic testing).  The pathology report for resection specimens should include the following features1 (synoptic reporting according to the College of American Pathologists protocol is required for accreditation purposes)2: Neoadjuvant therapy (and type) Operative procedure Tumor anatomic site Tumor size (greatest dimension) Tumor location and extent of invasion Add surface if tumor originates on periosteal surface (especially relevant for osteosarcoma subtypes) Add intracompartmental or extracompartmental (especially relevant for defining atypical cartilaginous tumors) Presence of skip metastases (discontinuous tumor) Histologic tumor type (WHO Classification)3 Histologic tumor grade Presence and extent of necrosis Treatment effect and extent Margin status R0, R1, or R2 (R classification system per AJCC)4 Distance to and localization of closest margin(s)  Necrotic tumor at margin for Ewing sarcoma is considered a negative (R0) margin if there is a complete pathologic response.5 Ancillary studies Decalcification should optimally be performed with solutions that preserve RNA and DNA; acid-based decalcification (other than EDTA) should therefore be avoided.1 Pathologic stage classification (AJCC 8th Edition)4 PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGY References Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-2 Overview Primary bone cancers are extremely rare neoplasms accounting for 0.2% of all cancers, although the true incidence is difficult to determine secondary to the rarity of these tumors.1 In 2023 an estimated 3,970 people will be diagnosed in the United States and 2,140 people will die from the disease.2 Primary bone cancers demonstrate wide clinical heterogeneity and may be curable with proper treatment. In adults, chondrosarcoma is the most common primary bone cancer, accounting for 40%, followed by osteosarcoma (28%), chordoma (10%), Ewing sarcoma (8%), and lastly undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS)fibrosarcoma (4%). In children and adolescents, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are far more common than chondrosarcoma and chordoma.3 High-grade UPS of bone, fibrosarcoma, and giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) are relatively rare tumors, with each constituting less than 5% of primary bone tumors.4 GCTB has both benign and malignant forms, with the benign form being the most common subtype. Various types of bone cancers are named based on their histologic origin: chondrosarcomas arise from cartilage, osteosarcomas arise from bone, and fibrogenic tissue is the origin of fibrosarcoma of bone, whereas vascular tissue gives rise to hemangioendothelioma and hemangiopericytoma. Several primary bone cancers, including Ewing sarcoma, are of unknown histologic origin. Chordoma is more common in males, with the peak incidence in the fifth to sixth decade of life.5,6 The pathogenesis and etiology of most bone cancers remain unclear."

Several primary bone cancers, including Ewing sarcoma, are of unknown histologic origin. Chordoma is more common in males, with the peak incidence in the fifth to sixth decade of life.5,6 The pathogenesis and etiology of most bone cancers remain unclear. Gene rearrangements between the EWS and ETS family of genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma.7-10 Specific germline mutations have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.11,12 Li-Fraumeni syndrome characterized by a germline mutation in the TP53 gene is associated with a high risk of developing osteosarcoma.13-15 Osteosarcoma is the most common second primary malignancy in patients with a history of retinoblastoma, characterized by a mutation in the retinoblastoma gene RB1.11,16,17 Increased incidences of osteosarcoma have also been associated with other genetic mutations and inherited genetic predisposition syndromes.11 Osteosarcoma is also the most common radiation-induced bone sarcoma.18,19 The development of multiagent chemotherapy regimens for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment has considerably improved the prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.20,21 With current multimodality treatment, approximately three quarters of all patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma are cured and 90% to 95% of patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma can be successfully treated with limb-sparing approaches rather than amputation.22 Survival rates have improved to almost 70% in patients with localized Ewing sarcoma.21 In patients with Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma, a cure is still achievable in selected patients diagnosed with metastatic disease at presentation.23,24 The 5-year survival across all types of primary bone cancers is 66.8%.1 The NCCN Guidelines for Bone Cancer focus on chordoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Although typically benign, GCTB is locally aggressive and can lead to significant bone destruction.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-3 Guidelines update, using the following search terms: chondrosarcoma OR chordoma OR Ewing sarcoma OR giant cell tumor of the bone OR osteosarcoma OR bone sarcoma OR primary bone cancer OR primary bone neoplasm OR primary bone tumor. The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial; Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines and discussed by the panel have been included in this version of the Discussion section (eg, e-publications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). Recommendations for which high-level evidence is lacking are based on the panels review of lower-level evidence and expert opinion. SensitiveInclusive Language Usage NCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use language that is person-first; not stigmatizing; anti-racist, anti-classist, anti- misogynist, anti-ageist, anti-ableist, and anti-fat-biased; and inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non-gendered language, instead focusing on organ-specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their future analyses."

NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their future analyses. Staging The eighth edition of the AJCC staging classification (2018) is based on the assessment of histologic grade (G), tumor size (T), and presence of regional (N) andor distant metastases (M).25 The NCCN Panel would like to clarify that although some studies interpret imaging before chemotherapy treatment based on the extent of tumor invasion relative to the periosteum (eg, extraperiosteal, intraperiosteal) for prognostic purposes, these terms do not specifically occur in any validated staging systems and the significance is unknown. Principles of Bone Cancer Management Multidisciplinary Team Involvement Primary bone tumors and selected metastatic tumors should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team of physicians with demonstrated expertise in the management of these tumors. Long-term surveillance and follow-up are necessary when considering the risk of recurrence and comorbidities associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT). Life-long follow-up is recommended for surveillance and treatment of late effects of surgery, RT, and chemotherapy in long-term survivors. Patients should be given a survivorship prescription to schedule follow-up with a multidisciplinary team. Fertility issues should be discussed with appropriate patients.26 For information on disease- and survivorship-related issues for adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients, please refer to the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology as clinically appropriate.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-4 family history of genetic predisposition to bone sarcomas may benefit from genetic consultation and testing. Diagnostic Workup Suspicion of a malignant bone tumor in a patient with a symptomatic lesion often begins when a poorly marginated lesion is seen on a plain radiograph. In patients 40 years, an aggressive, symptomatic bone lesion has a significant risk of being a malignant primary bone tumor, and referral to an orthopedic oncologist should be considered prior to further workup."

Diagnostic Workup Suspicion of a malignant bone tumor in a patient with a symptomatic lesion often begins when a poorly marginated lesion is seen on a plain radiograph. In patients 40 years, an aggressive, symptomatic bone lesion has a significant risk of being a malignant primary bone tumor, and referral to an orthopedic oncologist should be considered prior to further workup. In patients 40 years of age, CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast; bone scan; mammogram; and other imaging studies as clinically indicated should be performed if plain radiographs do not suggest a specific diagnosis.27 All patients with suspected bone sarcoma should undergo complete staging prior to biopsy. Prior to biopsy, consultation should be obtained with an orthopedic oncologist regarding appropriate pre-biopsy imaging. The standard staging workup for a suspected primary bone cancer should include chest imaging (chest radiograph or chest CT to detect pulmonary metastases), appropriate imaging of the primary site (plain radiographs, MRI for local staging, andor CT scan), and bone scan or PETCT.28 Whole-body MRI is a sensitive imaging technique for the detection of skeletal metastases in patients with small cell neoplasms, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma.29,30 Imaging of painless bone lesions should be evaluated by a musculoskeletal radiologist followed by appropriate referral to a multidisciplinary treatment team if necessary. Laboratory studies, such as complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) with calcium to assess for hypercalcemia, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) should be done prior to initiation of treatment. PETCT is an alternative imaging technique that has been utilized in the pretreatment staging of soft tissue and bone sarcomas.31,32 Published reports have demonstrated the utility of PET scans in the evaluation of response to chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and advanced chordoma.33-36 PETCT with the investigational radioactive substance 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) has been shown to identify the hypoxic component in residual chordomas prior to RT.37 This approach is being evaluated and would be helpful in identifying tumors with low oxygen levels that are more resistant to RT."

Biopsy Percutaneous biopsy (core needle or fine-needle aspiration FNA) and incisional (open) biopsy are the two techniques historically used in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal lesions.38,39 Open biopsy is the most accurate method because of larger sample size, which is useful for performing additional studies such as immunohistochemistry or cytogenetics.40 However, open biopsy requires general or regional anesthesia and operating room facilities, whereas core biopsy can be performed under local anesthesia, with or without sedation. Core needle biopsy has also been used as an alternative to open biopsy for the diagnosis of musculoskeletal lesions with accuracy rates ranging from 88% to 96% when adequate samples are obtained.41-44 Core biopsy is associated with a low complication rate and cost savings may be realized when needle biopsy is employed in selected patients.41,44,45 Advances in imaging techniques have contributed to the increasing use of image-guided percutaneous biopsy for the diagnosis of primary and secondary bone tumors.46 Furthermore, rates of complications, particularly altered treatment and outcomes, are considerably higher with open biopsy.47 Although no randomized controlled trials have compared core needle biopsy with open biopsy, the higher complication rate and cost of open biopsy have resulted in a shift to the use of primarily core biopsy for diagnosis. NCCN Guidelines and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN. NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-5 The guidelines recommend core needle or open biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of primary bone tumor prior to any surgical procedure or fixation of primary site. Biopsy should be performed at the center that will provide definitive treatment for patients with a suspected primary malignant bone tumor. At the time of biopsy, careful consideration should be given to appropriate stabilization of the bone andor measures to protect against impending pathologic fracture."

Biopsy should be performed at the center that will provide definitive treatment for patients with a suspected primary malignant bone tumor. At the time of biopsy, careful consideration should be given to appropriate stabilization of the bone andor measures to protect against impending pathologic fracture. The placement of biopsy is critical to the planning of limb-sparing surgery, and failure to follow appropriate biopsy procedures may lead to adverse patient outcomes.38,39 In a multicenter review of 597 patients with musculoskeletal tumors, alteration of the treatment plan (complex resection or the use of adjunctive treatment) was encountered in 19% of patients and unnecessary amputation was performed in 18 patients.47 Both core needle and open biopsy techniques are associated with risk of local tumor recurrence either by tumor spillage or tumor seeding along the biopsy tract, if the scar is not removed en bloc during the tumor resection. The risk of tumor seeding is less with core needle biopsy.48-50 Nevertheless, the same principles should be applied for core needle and open biopsy. Appropriate communication between the surgeon, musculoskeletal or interventional radiologist, and bone pathologist is critical in planning the biopsy route. In the case of children, consultation with a pediatric oncologist is recommended. It is essential to select the biopsy route in collaboration with the surgeon to ensure that the biopsy tract lies within the planned resection bed so that it can be resected with the same wide margins as the primary tumor during surgery. Although the risk of tumor seeding is not significant with FNA biopsy, it is not suitable for the diagnosis of primary lesions since the diagnostic accuracy of FNA is less than that of core needle biopsy.51 Surgery Surgical margins should be negative for most sarcomas, wide enough to minimize potential local recurrence, and narrow enough to maximize function. Wide excision implies histologically negative surgical margins and it is necessary to optimize local control. In selected cases, amputation may be the most appropriate option to achieve this goal. However, limb-sparing surgery is preferred if reasonable functional outcomes can be achieved. Final pathologic evaluation should include assessment of surgical margins and sizedimensions of tumor. The response to the preoperative therapy should be evaluated utilizing pathologic mapping. Consultation with a physiatrist is recommended to evaluate for mobility training and to prescribe an appropriate rehabilitation program."

Consultation with a physiatrist is recommended to evaluate for mobility training and to prescribe an appropriate rehabilitation program. Radiation Therapy RT is used either as an adjuvant to surgery for patients with resectable tumors or as definitive therapy in patients with tumors not amenable to surgery. Specialized techniques such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT); particle beam RT with protons, carbon ions, or other heavy ions; or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)stereotactic RT (SRT) should be considered as clinically indicated in order to deliver high radiation doses while maximizing normal tissue sparing.52,53 RT should be administered at the same specialized center that is providing surgical and systemic interventions.

They may also be distinguished by their location along the bone as follows: 1) primary or central lesions (arising normally from the medullary cavity) originating from previously normal-appearing bone preformed from cartilage; or 2) secondary or peripheral tumors (arising from the periosteum) that develop from preexisting benign cartilage lesions, such as enchondromas, or from the cartilaginous portion of an osteochondroma.54,56,57 Conventional chondrosarcoma of the bone constitutes approximately nearly 90% of all chondrosarcomas and of these 90% are low to intermediate grade.58 Malignant transformation has been reported in patients with Ollier disease (enchondromatosis) and Maffucci syndrome (enchondromatosis associated with soft tissue hemangioma).59 The peripheral or secondary tumors are usually low grade with infrequent metastasis.60 Nearly 65% of chondrosarcoma cases and nearly all cases of Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are related to isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 or IDH2) mutations.58,61-63 Other implicated genetic aberrations include inactivating mutations of CDKN2A and COL2A1.57 In addition to conventional chondrosarcoma, there are several non-conventional subtypes constituting about 10% to 15% of all chondrosarcomas.54 These include clear cell, juxtacortical, dedifferentiated, myxoid, and mesenchymal forms of chondrosarcoma.54,64,65 Primary skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (myxoid chondrosarcoma of bone) is an extremely rare neoplasm that has not been fully characterized as a distinct clinicopathologic entity.66,67 It is considered to be a myxoid variant of intermediate- or high-grade chondrosarcoma and is commonly located in the bones around the hip joint.54,67 An epidemiologic study of mesenchymal chondrosarcomas using the SEER database found that 40% of these were skeletal and 60% were extraskeletal.68 Research suggests that alterations in the retinoblastoma pathway are present in a significant majority of clear cell, dedifferentiated, and mesenchymal chondrosarcomas.64 Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, on the other hand, is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that is characterized by chromosomal translocations t(9;22)(q22;q11-12) or t(9;17)(q22;q11), generating the fusion genes EWS::CHN (EWSR1::NR4A3) or RBP56::CHN (TAF2N::NR4A3), respectively.69,70 In addition, two other variant chromosomal translocations, t(9;15)(q22;q21) and t(3;9)(q12;q22), resulting in fusion genes TCF12::NR4A3 and TFG::NR4A3, respectively, have also been identified in case reports.71 A retrospective study demonstrated prolonged overall survival (OS) in patients with extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma despite high rates of local and distant recurrence.72 The data also revealed a significant pattern of decreased event-free survival (EFS) with increasing tumor size."

Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma is not included in the NCCN Guidelines for Bone Cancer. Symptoms of chondrosarcoma are usually mild and depend on tumor size and location. Patients with pelvic or axial lesions typically present later in the disease course, as the associated pain has a more insidious onset and often occurs when the tumor has reached a significant size.73-75 Central chondrosarcomas demonstrate cortical destruction and loss of medullary bone trabeculations on radiographs, as well as calcification and destruction.74 MRI will show the intramedullary involvement as well as extraosseous extension of the tumor."

A cartilage cap measuring greater than 2 cm on a pre-existing lesion or documented growth after skeletal maturity should raise the suspicion of sarcomatous transformation.76 Prognostic Factors Whether the lesion is primary or secondary, central or peripheral, the anatomic location, histologic grade, and size of the lesion are essential prognostic features.68,73,77-81 In an analysis of 2890 patients with Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:11 AM.

Anatomic tumor location was a significant prognostic factor, with poorer OS observed among patients with axial versus cranial or appendicular tumor locations. Cranial tumors had different clinical behavior compared with axial and appendicular locations with data suggesting better OS for younger patients. Prognostic factors were also examined in a retrospective, multi-institutional analysis of 225 patients with low-grade chondrosarcoma.83 Metastasis-free survival (MFS) probability was 95% at 5 years and 92% at 10 years.

A low histologic grade and no recurrence had a significant MFS benefit, but tumor size at diagnosis and surgical margin width had no effect on MFS. In a SEER database analysis, differences in the presence of metastasis were noted among the various chondrosarcoma subtypes.65 Dedifferentiated (19.8%) followed by mesenchymal (10.6%) chondrosarcoma were most associated with the presence of metastasis on presentation, whereas juxtacortical chondrosarcoma was least associated (2.1%) with the presence of metastasis on presentation.65 Similarly, median survival was found to be lowest with the dedifferentiated subtype (11 months) and highest with the juxtacortical subtype (97 months).65 Treatment Surgery Wide excision with negative margins is the preferred primary treatment for patients with large tumors and pelvic localization, irrespective of the grade.79,84-86 Wide resection with adequate surgical margins is associated with higher EFS and OS rates in patients with chondrosarcoma of axial skeleton and pelvic girdle. The 10-year OS and EFS rates were 61% and 44%, respectively, for patients who underwent resection with adequate surgical margins compared to the corresponding survival rates of 17% and 0% for those who underwent resection with inadequate surgical margins.87 Intralesional curettage with adjuvant cryosurgery has been shown to be associated with low rates of recurrence in patients with grade I intracompartmental chondrosarcomas.88-90 In selected patients with low-grade and less radiographically aggressive, non-pelvic chondrosarcomas, intralesional excision can be used as an alternative to wide excision without compromising outcomes.91-94 This approach should be restricted to extremity tumors.95 Intralesional excision is considered the standard treatment for extremity chondrosarcoma tumors. In a meta-analysis comparing outcome in patients with central, low-grade (grade I) chondrosarcoma of the long bones following either intralesional excision or wide resection, there was little difference in the recurrence-free survival between both groups after 24 months. The rate of major complications was found to be higher following wide resection of the lesion (230 per 1000 vs. 40 per 1000 for intralesional curettage).96 Radiation Therapy Primary RT can be considered for borderline resectable and unresectable disease (category 2B)."

The indolent substudy included patients with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic soft tissue or bone sarcoma, which included 33 patients with grade 1 or 2 chondrosarcoma.117 The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months using the Choi criteria, which for patients with chondrosarcoma was 47%, just below the 50% cutoff for an active agent. Six patients had objective tumor response and four patients (12%) had stable disease for more than 1 year, suggesting some tumor control.

NCCN Recommendations The histologic grade and tumor locations are the most important variables that determine the choice of primary treatment. Wide excision or intralesional excision with or without an adjuvant are the primary treatment options for patients with resectable low-grade and intracompartmental lesions.92,93 Wide excision is the preferred treatment option for patients with pelvic low-grade chondrosarcomas.84 High-grade (grade II, III), clear cell, or extracompartmental lesions, if resectable, should be treated with wide excision obtaining negative surgical margins.87 Wide excision should provide negative surgical margins and may be achieved by either limb-sparing surgery or amputation. Postoperative treatment with proton andor photon beam RT may be useful for patients with tumors in an unfavorable location not amenable to resection, especially in chondrosarcomas of the skull base and axial skeleton.54,55 RT can be considered for patients with unresectable high- and low-grade lesions. However, since there are not enough data to support the use of RT in patients with chondrosarcoma, the panel has included this option as a category 2B recommendation. The guidelines suggest that patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcomas could be treated as per Ewing sarcoma, and those with dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas may be treated as osteosarcoma. Dasatinib, pazopanib, and ivosidenib are included as category 2A recommendations for select patients with chondrosarcoma. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) or targeted exon sequencing can be used to detect IDH1 mutations, a prerequisite for ivosidenib treatment. Metastatic Disease Metastatic chondrosarcoma that is not dedifferentiated or mesenchymal either after recurrence or at presentation can be classified as oligometastatic or widespread disease. In general, patients with oligometastatic disease are amenable to local control (potentially rendering it disease free), such as with resection or RT, or treated as part of a clinical trial (goal is disease freecure; more likely to proceed with surgery or radiation). Conversely, widespread disease cannot be treated by local resection or SBRT (goal is palliation). For oligometastatic disease that is resectable, NCCN recommends surgical excision of all sites of disease, if possible. For oligometastatic disease that is unresectable, consider RT that may include ablative therapy."

Chest imaging should occur every 3 to 6 months (may include CT at least biannually) for the first 5 years and yearly thereafter for a minimum of 10 years as clinically indicated, as late metastases and recurrences after 5 years are more common with chondrosarcoma than with other sarcomas.78 Functional assessment should be performed at every visit.

Chordoma Chordomas arise from the embryonic remnants of the notochord and are more common in older adults. Chordomas predominantly arise in the axial skeleton, with the sacrum (50%60%), skull base (25%35%), and spine (15%) being the most common primary sites.6,121 Chordomas are traditionally classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) into three histologic variants: conventional, chondroid, and dedifferentiated. Conventional chordomas are the most common histologic subtype characterized by the absence of cartilaginous or mesenchymal components. Chondroid chordomas present with histologic features of chordoma and cartilage elements, accounting for 5% to 15% of all chordomas. Dedifferentiated chordomas constitute about 2% to 8% of all chordomas and have features of high-grade pleomorphic spindle cell soft tissue sarcoma and an aggressive clinical course.121 More recently, an additional subset of chordoma has been identified in children. Poorly differentiated chordoma is characterized molecularly by the absence of SMARCB1 expression. The protein encoded by SMARCB1 is a chromatin remodeling agent and its absence is also implicated in the pathogenesis of some sarcomas, including but not limited to epithelioid sarcoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor, and epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). It is reported that poorly differentiated chordoma may be more common in the pediatric population and show a predilection for occurrence in the skull base and cervical spine. Although further research is warranted, poorly differentiated chordoma is considered to be more aggressive than either the conventional or chondroid variants with a poorer OS.122 Chordomas of the spine and sacrum present with localized deep pain or radiculopathies, whereas cervical chordomas can cause airway obstruction or dysphagia and might present as an oropharyngeal mass. Neurologic deficit is more often associated with chordomas of the skull base and mobile spine than chordomas of sacrococcygeal region.6 A review of 47 patients with skull base chordomas suggested that male sex was associated with worse PFS and OS.123 Workup Initial workup should include history and physical examination with adequate primary site imaging (ie, x-ray, MRI  CT), screening MRI of spinal axis (MRICT with contrast), and chestabdominalpelvic CT with contrast.

Ewing sarcoma is also characterized by the strong expression of cell surface glycoprotein MIC2 (CD99).199,200 The expression of MIC2 may be useful in the differential diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) from other small round-cell neoplasms, although it is not exclusively specific to these tumors.201 Similar in morphology with various molecular signatures, Ewing-like sarcomas are a heterogenous group of tumors that namely affect the pediatric and adolescent population.202 Ewing-like tumors have been divided into three main categories based on cytogenetics: CIC-rearranged sarcomas (eg, CIC::DUX4), BCOR-rearranged sarcomas, and round cell sarcomas with EWSR1 fusions with non-ETS genes.203 Typically, Ewing sarcoma occurs in AYAs. The most common primary sites are the pelvic bones, femur, and the bones of the chest wall, although any bone may be affected.20 When arising in a long bone, the diaphysis is the most frequently affected site. Periosteal reaction is classic and it is referred to as onion skin by radiologists. Patients with Ewing sarcoma, as with most patients with bone sarcomas, seek attention because of localized pain or swelling.

Prognostic Factors The important indicators of favorable prognosis include a distalperipheral site of primary disease, tumor volume less than 100 mL, normal LDH level at presentation, and the absence of metastatic disease at the time of presentation.204-210 Ewing sarcoma in the spine and sacrum is associated with significantly worse outcome and prognosis than primary Ewing sarcoma in other sites.211 In a systematic review, Bosma and colleagues also reported tumor size (diameter 8 cm) and histologic response (90% necrosis) to be important prognostic variables.212 Nevertheless, metastatic disease at presentation is the most significant adverse prognostic factor in Ewing sarcoma, as it is for other bone sarcomas.23,208,213 The lungs, bone, and bone marrow are the most common sites of metastasis. In a retrospective analysis of 975 patients from the EICESS Study Group, 5-year RFS was 22% for patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis compared with 55% for patients without metastases at diagnosis.23 Among patients with metastases, there was a trend for better survival for those with lung metastases compared to those with bone metastases or a combination of lung and bone metastases.23 Metastases to uncommon sites (ie, brain, liver, spleen) were associated with a worse prognosis in a retrospective study of 30 patients.214 Poor histologicradiologic response to chemotherapy has also been identified as an adverse prognostic factor in patients with localized non-metastatic disease,207,215,216 even when chemotherapy was followed by R0 resection.217 The results of the IESS study analyzing the clinicopathologic features of 303 cases of Ewing sarcoma showed that patients with primary tumors in Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:11 AM.

The 5-year OS rate was also significantly better among patients in the VACD-IE group (72% and 61%, respectively; P  .01). VACD-IE also was associated with lower incidences of local failure (11%) compared with VACD (30%) irrespective of the type of local control therapy; 5-year cumulative incidences of local failure were 30% in the VACD arm compared with 11% in the VACD-IE arm.241 While dose escalation of alkylating agents in the VDC (vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide)-IE regimen did not improve the outcome for patients with localized disease,242 chemotherapy intensification through interval compression improved outcome in patients with localized disease.243 In a randomized trial for patients 50 years with localized Ewing sarcoma (n  568), Womer and colleagues reported that VDC-IE given on an every-2-week schedule was found to be more effective than VDC-IE given on an every-3-week schedule, with no increase in toxicity; median 5-year EFS was 73% and 65%, respectively.243 The Euro Ewing 2012 (EE2012) was a randomized analysis conducted to compare the induction and consolidation regimens for newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma in both the United States and Europe. Six hundred forty patients between the ages of 5 to 50 years were randomized to two treatment arms, A and B. Treatment arm A received the European regimen: VIDE (vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide) induction therapy followed by VAI (vincristine, dactinomycin, and ifosfamide) or VAC consolidation. Treatment arm B received the U.S. regimen: compressed VDCIE induction followed by IEVC consolidation. The primary endpoint of the study was PFS while the secondary endpoints were OS and toxicity. The VDCIE regimen proved superior to the European regimen in terms of PFS and OS with similar toxicity profiles.244 IESS-I and IESS-II showed that RT plus adjuvant chemotherapy with VACD was superior to VAC in patients with localized non-metastatic disease.232 The 5-year RFS rates were 60% and 24% for VACD and VAC, respectively (P  .001)."

HDTHCT has been associated with potential survival benefit in patients with non-metastatic disease.248,249 However, studies that have evaluated HDTHCT in patients with primary metastatic disease have shown conflicting results.250-256 The EURO-EWING 99 study was the first large randomized trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiagent induction chemotherapy with six courses of VIDE, local treatment (surgery andor RT), and HDTHCT in 281 patients with Ewing sarcoma with primary disseminated disease.251 After a median follow-up of 3.8 years, the EFS and OS rates at 3 years for the entire study cohort were 27% and 34%, respectively.255 The EFS rates were 57% and 25%, respectively, for patients with complete and partial response after HDTHCT. Patients age, tumor volume, and extent of metastatic spread were identified as relevant risk factors. The outcome of patients with and without HDTHCT was not performed because of the bias introduced early in the non-transplant group (82% of patients without HDTHCT died after a median time of 1 year). The EURO-EWING 99 and Ewing-2008 randomized trial asked whether consolidation high-dose chemotherapy improved survival in patients with localized Ewing sarcoma.256 Two hundred forty high-risk patients were randomly assigned to receive seven VAI courses (n  118) or one course of busulfan and melphalan (BuMel) HDT with autologous HCT (n  122), after a VIDE six-course induction plus one VAI consolidation course.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-19 Disease should be restaged with imaging following primary treatment. Chest imaging should be performed with CT (with or without contrast as clinically indicated) and primary site imaging should include MRI with or without CT (both with contrast) and plain radiograph. Head-to-toe PETCT andor bone scan can be used for restaging depending on the imaging technique that was used in the initial workup. Patients with stable or improved disease after primary treatment should be treated with local control therapy. Local control options include wide excision, definitive RT with chemotherapy, or amputation in selected cases.258,260,262,264 The choice of local control therapy should be individualized and is dependent on tumor location, size, response to chemotherapy, patients age, anticipated morbidity, and patient preference.241 Adjuvant chemotherapy following wide excision or amputation is recommended for all patients regardless of surgical margins. The panel strongly recommends that the duration of chemotherapy following wide excision or amputation should be between 28 and 49 weeks depending on the type of regimen and the dosing schedule (category 1).231-233 The addition of postoperative RT to chemotherapy is recommended for patients with positive or very close surgical margins.258 Denbo and colleagues reported that in patients with smaller tumor size (8 cm) and negative margins, postoperative RT can be omitted without any decrement in OS.268 The 15-year estimated OS for patients who received adjuvant RT was 80% compared to 100% for those who did not.

In both trials, patients reported some benefit with WLI and chemotherapy when compared to chemotherapy alone. For instance, in the EICESS-92 trial, patients who also received WLI showed a 12% improvement in 5-year OS.273,274 Ultimately, it was concluded that the decision to use WLI should be based on the patients risk of pulmonary metastases and any coexisting respiratory diseases.273 Progressive disease following primary treatment is best managed with RT andor surgery to primary site followed by chemotherapy or best supportive care.

Combination therapy with vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide also appears to be active and well-tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma, with an ORR of 68.1%.290 A review of 107 patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma examined the combination of etoposide with a platinum agent (ie, cisplatin or carboplatin), suggesting that further study of etoposidecarboplatin may be warranted.291 HDTHCT has been associated with improved long-term survival in patients with relapsed or progressive Ewing sarcoma in small, single-institution studies.292-294 The role of this approach is yet to be determined in prospective randomized studies. The CABONE trial, a multicenter, single-arm phase 2 trial, evaluated the activity of cabozantinib in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma.295 Currently approved for renal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and medullary thyroid cancer, cabozantinib is a VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with inhibitory activity against the MET receptor. For Ewing sarcoma, the primary endpoint in this study was a 6-month objective response, while the secondary endpoints included safety, 6-month non-progression, best overall response, 1-year and 2-year PFS and OS, and metabolic response (evaluated by 18F-FDG-PETCT 28 days after the first dose). The primary endpoint was reached with a 6-month objective response of 26% (95% CI, 1342) among 39 patients with Ewing sarcoma. Additionally, the median OS was reported to be 10.2 months with a median PFS of 4.4 months. OS was noted to be 84% at 6 months, 48% at 12 months, and finally 14% at 24 months.

Lastly, cabozantinib was found to be well-tolerated among patients with the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects being hypophosphatemia, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), palmar-plantar syndrome, pneumothorax, and neutropenia.295 Docetaxel in combination with gemcitabine was well-tolerated, resulting in an overall ORR of 29% in children and young adults with refractory bone sarcomas; median duration of response was 4.8 months.296 The combination of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory bone sarcomas297 A recent single-arm phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of lurbinectedin in a cohort of 28 adult patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma.298 Treatment with lurbinectedin resulted in an ORR of 14.3% and a median DOR of 4.2 months. In a study evaluating 26 patients treated for local recurrence of Ewing sarcoma, surgical treatment was associated with better survival (P  .001).299 In addition to chemotherapy, surgery may be a treatment option for some patients who experience relapse. NCCN Recommendations Treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory disease include participation in a clinical trial and chemotherapy (with or without RT or with or without surgery). See Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents in the algorithm for a list of other chemotherapy regimens recommended for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. All patients with recurrent and metastatic disease should be considered for clinical trials investigating new treatment approaches. Giant Cell Tumor of Bone GCTB is a rare benign primary tumor of the bone accounting for about 3% to 5% of all primary bone tumors, with a strong tendency for local recurrence and that may metastasize to the lungs.300,301 GCTB usually occurs between 20 and 40 years of age. The meta-epiphyseal regions of the distal femur and proximal tibia are the most common primary sites.302 Malignant transformation to high-grade osteosarcoma has been observed in rare cases and is associated with a poor prognosis.303,304 Workup Initial workup should include history and physical examination with imaging (ie, x-ray, MRI with contrast  CT) of the primary site as clinically indicated, in addition to chest imaging."

CT is useful to define the extent of cortical destruction, whereas MRI is the preferred imaging modality to assess the extension of tumors into the adjacent soft tissue and neurovascular structures.305,306 Chest imaging is essential to identify the presence of metastatic disease. Brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism should be considered as a differential diagnosis; routine evaluation of serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone levels can help exclude this diagnosis.307 If there is malignant transformation, treat as osteosarcoma. Treatment Surgery Wide excision and intralesional curettage are the two surgical treatment options for patients with resectable tumors.308-314 Wide excision is associated with a lower risk of local recurrence than intralesional curettage, with the local recurrence rates ranging from 0% to 12% for wide excision and 12% to 65% for intralesional curettage. In some studies, the extent of intralesional excision and the tumor stage have been identified as prognostic indicators for risk of recurrence.315-317 Blackley and Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:11 AM.

However, the findings from studies that have evaluated intralesional curettage, with and without adjuvant in the same cohort of patients with primary or recurrent GCTB, are inconsistent, with some reporting decreased local recurrence rates with the use of adjuvants.312,318-321 Others, however, have reported no significant difference in local recurrence rates with and without adjuvants.138,322,323 Wide excision is also associated with poor functional outcome and greater surgical complications.324-328 Therefore, intralesional curettage is considered the treatment of choice in a majority of patients with stage I or II tumors. Wide excision is usually reserved for more aggressive stage III tumors with extraosseous extension or otherwise unresectable tumors.317,329-332 Radiation Therapy RT has been used either as a primary treatment or in combination with surgery to improve local control and DFS for patients with marginally resected, unresectable, progressive, or recurrent disease.333-344 In a retrospective analysis of 58 patients with GCTB (45 patients with primary tumor and 13 patients with recurrent tumor) treated with RT, the 5-year local control and OS rates were 85% and 94%, respectively.343 Median follow-up was 8 years. In this analysis, patient age was the only prognostic factor with local control rates (96% for younger patients vs. 73% for the older group) as well as OS (100% vs. 87%) and DFS rates (96% vs. 65%).

Therefore, the panel recommends that RT should be considered if no other treatment options are available, if possible. Systemic Therapy Denosumab (a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against the RANK ligand) has demonstrated activity in patients with unresectable or recurrent GCTB.347-353 In June 2013, denosumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with GCTB that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity. Several phase II trials have examined the efficacy of denosumab for treating primary and recurrent GCTB. In an open-label, phase II study (n  37), denosumab induced tumor response (defined as the elimination of at least 90% of giant cells or no radiologic progression of the target lesion for up to 25 weeks) in 86% (30 of 35 evaluable patients) of patients with unresectable or recurrent GCTB.347 An open-label, parallel-group, phase II study divided patients with GCTB into three cohorts: those with unresectable GCTB (cohort 1), those with resectable GCTB associated with severe surgical morbidity (cohort 2), and those transferred from a Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:11 AM.

The risk of local recurrence has been reported to be higher when denosumab is used prior to curettage. In a retrospective analysis of 408 patients treated for GCTB using either intralesional curettage or wide excision, the local recurrence rate for patients treated with curettage and denosumab was 60%, compared to 16% for those individuals treated with curettage alone.356 Additionally, the joint preservation rate of patients treated with curettage and denosumab was 80% compared to 94% for those treated with curettage alone. Although denosumab usage was reported to be the only independent factor associated with increased recurrence, it is likely that such an association may also stem from selection bias.356 Use of denosumab before surgery, however, may aid in defining a peripheral rim around the tumor.357,358 Phase II trial data have also suggested that sequential FDG-PET imaging appears to be a sensitive tool for early detection of tumor response to denosumab treatment.359 There have been reports of increased risk of developing osteosarcoma associated with denosumab therapy.360,361 The data are limited to determine the cause of the increased risk, but the NCCN Panel identifies some possibilities, such as spontaneous conversion to a secondary sarcoma, or a diagnostic andor sampling error that erroneously categorizes a tumor as GCTB. In prior versions of the guidelines, interferon (IFN) was recommended as a treatment option, based on case reports that reported the efficacy of IFN in the management of GCTB.362-365 However, since IFN is no longer available in the United States, it has been removed as a treatment option in the guidelines. NCCN Recommendations Localized Disease Intralesional excision with an effective adjuvant may be an adequate primary treatment for resectable tumors.138,322,323 Serial arterial embolizations have been shown to be effective in the comprehensive care of patients with giant cell tumors of the extremities, especially for tumors with large cortical defects or joint involvement and for those with large giant cell tumors of the sacrum.366-369 For patients with lesions that are resectable with unacceptable morbidity andor unresectable axial lesions, the guidelines have included denosumab andor serial embolization as preferred options."

Denosumab, observation, and RT are options for patients with unresectable metastases. Surveillance Surveillance should include a physical exam, imaging (ie, x-ray, CT  MRI both with contrast) of the surgical site as clinically indicated, and chest imaging. As the average time to metastasis ranges from approximately 2 to 4 years,371,372 chest imaging should be performed every 6 to 12 months for 4 years, then annually thereafter, as clinically indicated.

Osteosarcoma Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and young adults. In adults 65 years, osteosarcoma develops as a secondary malignancy related to Paget disease of the bone.16 Osteosarcoma is broadly classified into three histologic subtypes (intramedullary, surface, and extraskeletal).373 High-grade intramedullary osteosarcoma is the classic or conventional form comprising nearly 80% of osteosarcomas.373 It is a spindle cell tumor that produces osteoid or immature bone. The most frequent sites are the metaphyseal areas of the distal femur or proximal tibia, which are the sites of maximum growth. Low-grade intramedullary osteosarcoma comprises less than 2% of all osteosarcomas and the most common sites are similar to that of conventional osteosarcoma.374 Parosteal and periosteal osteosarcomas are juxtacortical or surface variants. Parosteal osteosarcomas are low-grade lesions accounting for up to 5% of all osteosarcomas.374 The most common site is the posterior distal femur. Transformation of low-grade parosteal osteosarcoma into high-grade sarcoma has been documented in 24% to 43% of cases.375,376 Periosteal osteosarcomas are intermediate-grade lesions most often involving the femur followed by the tibia.374 High-grade surface osteosarcomas are very rare accounting for 10% of all juxtacortical osteosarcomas.377,378 Pain and swelling are the most frequent early symptoms. Pain is often intermittent in the beginning and a thorough workup sometimes is delayed because symptoms may be confused with growing pains. Osteosarcoma spreads hematogenously, with the lung being the most common metastatic site. For treating extraskeletal osteosarcomas, please see the NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

Fertility preservation methods and alternatives should be discussed with patients as appropriate. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends that conversations concerning fertility be undertaken by an interdisciplinary medical team comprised of oncologists, reproductive endocrinologists and urologists, and reproductive surgeons trained in fertility preservation methods and that fertility preservation programs be affiliated with an experienced assisted reproductive technology (ART) program.394,395 For further details and recommendations, refer to the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology. Finally, a number of genetic aberrations may underly osteosarcoma.396 For instance, it is reported that nearly 70% of patients with osteosarcoma may exhibit mutations in the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma gene, Rb.396 Genetic cancer syndromes that exhibit a predisposition for osteosarcoma include: Li-Fraumeni syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome type 2, Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, RAPADILINO syndrome, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia."

    "text": "Finally, a number of genetic aberrations may underly osteosarcoma.396 For instance, it is reported that nearly 70% of patients with osteosarcoma may exhibit mutations in the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma gene, Rb.396 Genetic cancer syndromes that exhibit a predisposition for osteosarcoma include: Li-Fraumeni syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome type 2, Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, RAPADILINO syndrome, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Thus, the NCCN Panel recommends that genetic consultation and testing be considered for patients diagnosed with chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma who possess a family or personal history of bone sarcomas.11 Treatment Surgery Surgery (limb-sparing surgery or amputation) remains an essential part of comprehensive care of patients with osteosarcoma.397 Studies that have compared limb-sparing surgery and amputation in patients with high-grade, non-metastatic osteosarcoma have not shown any significant difference in survival and local recurrence rates between these procedures.398-400 However, limb-sparing surgery is associated with better functional outcomes.401 In patients with high-grade osteosarcomas with good histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, limb-sparing surgery is considered the preferred surgical modality if wide surgical margins can be achieved.398,402 Amputation is generally reserved for patients with tumors in unfavorable anatomical locations not amenable to limb-sparing surgery with adequate surgical margins.397,402 Chemotherapy The addition of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens to surgery has improved outcomes in patients with localized osteosarcoma. Early trials used chemotherapy regimens including at least three or more of the following drugs: doxorubicin, cisplatin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide, dactinomycin, and high-dose methotrexate.403-408 Subsequent clinical trials have demonstrated that short, intensive chemotherapy regimens including cisplatin and doxorubicin with or without high-dose methotrexate and ifosfamide produce excellent long-term results, similar to those achieved with multiagent chemotherapy.409-416 Cisplatindoxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin (MAP) are included as category 1 recommended regimens for first-line therapy. In the event a patient receiving high-dose methotrexate experiences delayed elimination due to renal impairment, glucarpidase is strongly recommended.

However, the 5-year OS was similar in both arms and there was no significant difference in 5-year EFS rates.418 Good histopathologic response (90% necrosis) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be predictive of survival regardless of the type of chemotherapy administered after surgery.275,419,420 In an analysis of 881 patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma of the extremities treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery at the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute, Bacci and colleagues showed that the 5-year DFS and OS correlated significantly with histologic response to chemotherapy.421 The 5-year DFS and OS in good and poor responders were 67.9% versus 51.3% (P  .0001) and 78.4% versus 63.7% (P  .0001), respectively. A report from the Childrens Oncology Group also confirmed these findings; the 8-year postoperative EFS and OS rates were 81% and 87%, respectively, in good responders.419 The corresponding survival rates were 46% and 52%, respectively, in poor responders. Localized Disease The guidelines recommend wide excision as the primary treatment for patients with low-grade (intramedullary and surface) osteosarcomas and periosteal lesions. If pathologic high-grade disease is discovered after wide excision, adjuvant chemotherapy is a category 1 recommendation. Long-term results (25 years of follow-up) from patients with high-grade, localized osteosarcoma reveal significant benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy on DFS and OS.420 Chemotherapy prior to wide excision could be considered for patients with periosteal lesions.

Surgical re-resection with or without RT can be considered for positive surgical margins. In a study of 119 patients with osteosarcoma of the head and neck, combined modality treatment with surgery and RT (vs. surgery alone) improved local control and OS for patients with positive or uncertain surgical margins.425 Combined photonproton or proton beam RT has been shown to be effective for local control in some patients with unresectable or incompletely resected osteosarcoma.426,427 Patients whose disease has a poor response (viable tumor is 10% of the tumor area) could be considered for chemotherapy with a different regimen (category 3). However, attempts to improve the outcome of poor responders by modifying the adjuvant chemotherapy remain unsuccessful.428-432 Upon review of the evidence for the 2018 update, this recommendation was changed from category 2B to category 3. Recent data from the European and American Osteosarcoma Study (EURAMOS) Group trial429,433 informing this panel decision are discussed below. A randomized phase III trial of the EURAMOS Group evaluated treatment strategies for resectable osteosarcoma based on histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy. RT or adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended if the sarcoma remains unresectable following preoperative chemotherapy. The EURAMOS-1 trial included cohorts that received maintenance therapy with MAP (methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin); MAP with IFN--2b therapy; or MAP with ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE). The addition of maintenance IFN--2b therapy to MAP in the adjuvant setting did not improve outcomes for good responders to preoperative chemotherapy.433 However, the authors note that a significant portion of patients in the IFN arm did not receive the intended dose of IFN--2b due to failure to initiate therapy or premature termination of therapy. Additionally, adding ifosfamide and etoposide to MAP (ie, MAPIE) failed to improve outcomes for poor responders to preoperative chemotherapy.429 Chemotherapy should include appropriate growth factor support.

Therefore, under second-line options for patients with osteosarcoma, sorafenib in combination with everolimus is categorized under Other Recommended Regimens (category 2B recommendation). The safety and efficacy of HDTHCT in patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or relapsed osteosarcoma have also been evaluated.459,460 In the Italian Sarcoma Group study, treatment with carboplatin and etoposide was followed by stem cell rescue, combined with surgery-induced complete response in chemosensitive disease.460 Transplant-related mortality was 3.1%. The efficacy of this approach in patients with high-risk disease is yet to be determined in prospective randomized studies. The optimal treatment strategy for patients with relapsed or refractory disease has yet to be defined. If relapse occurs, the patient should receive second-line chemotherapy andor surgical resection when feasible, followed by imaging to assess treatment response. See the Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents in the algorithm for a complete list of second-line chemotherapy regimens.

See the Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents in the algorithm for a complete list of second-line chemotherapy regimens. Surveillance is recommended for patients with disease that responds to second-line therapy. Patients with disease progression or relapse after second-line therapy could be treated with resection, palliative RT (that may include Sm- 153-EDTMP), or best supportive care. High-Grade Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma of Bone High-grade UPS of the bone most frequently arises in the appendicular skeleton and is associated with both a high rate of local recurrence and local nodal and distal metastases.461 The addition of chemotherapy to surgery has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with non-metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH).462-464 In the European Osteosarcoma Intergroup study, adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cisplatin resulted in good pathologic response rates and survival (quite comparable with those for osteosarcoma) in patients with non-metastatic MFH.464 Median survival time was 63 months, and the 5-year PFS and OS rates were 56% and 59%, respectively. The guidelines recommend that patients with high-grade UPS of bone should be treated with regimens listed for osteosarcoma (category 2B). Comprehensive Genomic Profiling for Bone Cancer CGP is defined as next-generationbased molecular assays that provide genomic information about tumors and mechanism of disease to facilitate clinical decision-making.465 Due to the availability of new targeted therapies, patients with bone cancer may benefit from CGP. In a single-center chart review study of 102 patients with advanced sarcoma (including 11% with osteosarcoma, 4% with chondrosarcoma, 3% with chordoma, and 3% with Ewing sarcoma), 93% had at least one genomic alteration and 61% had a potentially actionable alteration based on CGP. Out of the 16% of patients who received targeted therapy based on the CGP results, 50% achieved at least stable disease.466 CGP or another fusion panel should be considered for Ewing sarcoma to identify translocations if pathologic workup of targeted PCR, FISH, or cytogenetics is negative. NCCN also recommends that CGP with a validated andor FDA-approved assay should be considered to determine Printed by Jebasingh J on 11242024 10:56:11 AM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-32 targeted therapy opportunities for patients with metastatic chondrosarcoma, recurrent chordoma, metastatic Ewing sarcoma, and metastatic osteosarcoma. Immunotherapy for Bone Cancer Immunotherapies harness the immune system to attack and destroy tumors. New cancer therapies are based on what we know about immune regulation and immune system checkpoints. The immune system is hardwired to regulate itself to maintain self-tolerance, ensuring that no unnecessary damage is done to harm the body after responding to a foreign antigen. For example, some immune cells upregulate cell surface molecules, such as the well-characterized cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 pathway (PD-1PD-L1), which serve as immune checkpoints that regulate the activation and function of T cells. The self-tolerance enabled by these molecules and other mechanisms is also employed by cancer cells to evade recognition by the immune system. Immune checkpoint blockade is used as cancer therapies reverse T-cell tolerance by blocking inhibitory interactions between tumor cells and infiltrating T cells, thus allowing an antitumor immune response.467-469 Identifying patients whose disease will respond to checkpoint blockade has been difficult to assess, partly due to the difficulty in measuring dynamic immune-related molecules.470 Determining tumor mutational burden has helped predict responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitors.471,472 A high tumor mutation load was also associated with genetic alterations, such as microsatellite instability (MSI), that may lead to dysregulation in DNA repair mechanisms.473 A study analyzing genomes in over 100 tumor types found that a mutational hotspot in the promoter of a DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene is associated with high tumor mutational load.471 Cases of high mutation load have been identified in most cancer types and may identify patients who could benefit from immunotherapy."

While median PFS and OS were not reached, estimates of these outcomes at 1- and 2-year survival are 64% and 53% for PFS and 76% and 64% for OS.475 The FDA later granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab, a PD-1blocking antibody used as a systemic treatment option for adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-high (MSI-H) or dMMR solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.476 A multicohort, single-arm, open-label phase II study (KEYNOTE-158) evaluated the activity of pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors.477 Patients were evaluated for tissue tumor mutational burden (tTMB) status by NGS and those with TMB-high (TMB- H) status (defined as 10 mutationsmegabase) exhibited clinical improvement with an ORR of 29% compared to 6% among the non tTMB-H group.477 The FDA has since approved pembrolizumab as a treatment option for patients with advanced solid tumors that are TMB-high and possess no alternative treatment options.478 To inform use of pembrolizumab, testing for TMB and MMRMSI as determined by a validated andor FDA-approved assay should be considered.479 NCCN recommends this treatment only for patients with MSI-HdMMR or tTMB-H chondrosarcomas, chordomas, Ewing sarcomas, and osteosarcomas. NCCN does not recommend this systemic treatment for GCTB since it is not technically a malignant tumor.

The ORR rate with nivolumabipilimumab was 35.3% for those with tTMB-H in an interim analysis, and 22.5% in those with high blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB-H) in a final analysis.480 Based on these data, nivolumabipilimumab was added as an immunotherapy option in the guidelines for TMB-H (10 mutationsmegabase) tumors in patients with unresectable or metastatic tumors (excluding GCTB) who have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, chordoma, and Ewing sarcoma are among the most common forms of primary bone cancers, while high-grade UPS and GCTB are relatively rare. Wide excision is the preferred treatment for resectable low- and high-grade chondrosarcomas. Intralesional excision with or without surgical adjuvant is an alternative option for less radiographically aggressive, non-pelvic, low-grade chondrosarcomas. Proton andor photon beam RT may be useful for patients with chondrosarcomas of the skull base and axial skeleton with tumors in unfavorable location not amenable to resection. Chemotherapy has little role in the comprehensive care of patients with chondrosarcoma. Chordomas arise from the embryonic remnants of the notochord and are more common in older adults. For patients with resectable conventional or chondroid chordomas, wide excision with or without RT is the primary treatment option for chordomas of the sacrum and mobile spine, whereas intralesional excision with or without RT is the treatment of choice for skull base tumors. Adjuvant RT can be considered for large extra-compartmental tumors or for positive surgical margins following resection. RT is the primary treatment option for patients with unresectable chordomas, irrespective of the location of the tumor. Systemic therapy (alone or in combination with surgery or RT) is recommended for patients with recurrent tumors. Poorly differentiated or dedifferentiated chordomas are usually managed as described in the NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma. EWS::FLI1 fusion gene resulting from t(11;22) chromosomal translocation is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in the majority of patients."

EWS::FLI1 fusion gene resulting from t(11;22) chromosomal translocation is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in the majority of patients. Multiagent chemotherapy is the primary treatment and patients with disease that responds to primary treatment are treated with local control therapy (wide excision, definitive RT with chemotherapy, or amputation in selected cases) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy following wide excision or amputation is recommended for all patients regardless of surgical margins. Chemotherapy (alone or in combination with RT or surgery) is recommended for those who experience relapse following adjuvant treatment. Progressive disease is best managed with RT with or without surgery followed by chemotherapy or best supportive care. Intralesional excision with an effective adjuvant is an adequate primary treatment for resectable tumors. Denosumab, serial embolizations, and RT are included as primary treatment options for patients with lesions that are resectable with acceptable morbidity or unresectable axial lesions.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 Bone Cancer MS-34 Osteosarcoma occurs mainly in children and young adults. Wide excision is the primary treatment for patients with low-grade osteosarcomas, whereas neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by wide excision is the preferred option for patients with high-grade osteosarcoma. Chemotherapy prior to wide excision can be considered for patients with periosteal lesions. Following wide excision, adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients with low-grade or periosteal sarcomas with pathologic findings of high-grade disease and those with high-grade sarcoma. RT or chemotherapy are recommended if the sarcoma remains unresectable after preoperative chemotherapy. Patients with relapsed or refractory disease should be treated with second-line therapy. Progressive disease is managed with surgery, palliative RT, or best supportive care. Preoperative chemotherapy followed by wide excision of the primary and metastatic tumors is recommended for patients with resectable metastases. Chemotherapy, metastasectomy, SRT, and ablation are included as options for the management of metastatic disease."
